<p class='c005'>In the summer of 1865, and in the following winter, I
made two visits to the South, spending four months in eight
of the principal States which had lately been in rebellion.
I saw the most noted battle-fields of the war. I made acquaintance
with officers and soldiers of both sides. I followed
in the track of the destroying armies. I travelled by railroad,
by steamboat, by stage-coach, and by private conveyance;
meeting and conversing with all sorts of people, from
high State officials to “low-down” whites and negroes; endeavoring,
at all times and in all places, to receive correct
impressions of the country, of its inhabitants, of the great
contest of arms just closed, and of the still greater contest
of principles not yet terminated.</p>

<p class='c000'>This book is the result. It is a record of actual observations
and conversations, free from fictitious coloring. Such
stories as were told me of the war and its depredations would
have been spoiled by embellishment; pictures of existing conditions,
to be valuable, must be faithful; and what is now
most desirable, is not hypothesis or declamation, but the light
of plain facts upon the momentous question of the hour,
which must be settled, not according to any political or sectional
bias, but upon broad grounds of Truth and Eternal
Right.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have accordingly made my narrative as ample and as
literally faithful as the limits of these pages, and of my own
opportunities, would allow. Whenever practicable, I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>stepped aside and let the people I met speak for themselves.
Notes taken on the spot, and under all sorts of circumstances,—on
horseback, in jolting wagons, by the firelight
of a farm-house, or negro camp, sometimes in the dark, or in
the rain,—have enabled me to do this in many cases with
absolute fidelity. Conversations which could not be reported
in this way, were written out as soon as possible after they took
place, and while yet fresh in my memory. Idiomatic peculiarities,
which are often so expressive of character, I have
reproduced without exaggeration. To intelligent and candid
men it was my habit to state frankly my intention to publish
an account of my journey, and then, with their permission, to
jot down such views and facts as they saw fit to impart.
Sometimes I was requested not to report certain statements of
an important nature, made in the glow of conversation; these,
not without regret, I have suppressed; and I trust that in no
instance have I violated a confidence that was reposed in me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I may add that the conversations recorded are generally of
a representative character, being selected from among hundreds
of such; and that if I have given seemingly undue prominence
to any subject, it has been because I found it an absorbing and
universal topic of discussion.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the month of August, 1865, I set out to visit some of
the scenes of the great conflict through which the country had
lately passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the twelfth I reached Harrisburg,—a plain, prosaic
town of brick and wood, with nothing especially attractive
about it except its broad-sheeted, shining river, flowing down
from the Blue Ridge, around wooded islands, and between
pleasant shores.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is in this region that the traveller from the North first
meets with indications of recent actual war. The Susquehanna,
on the eastern shore of which the city stands, forms the
northern limit of Rebel military operations. The “high-water
mark of the Rebellion” is here: along these banks its uttermost
ripples died. The bluffs opposite the town are still
crested with the hastily constructed breastworks, on which the
citizens worked night and day in the pleasant month of June,
1863, throwing up, as it were, a dike against the tide of invasion.
These defences were of no practical value. They were
unfinished when the Rebels appeared in force in the vicinity:
Harrisburg might easily have been taken, and a way opened
into the heart of the North. But a Power greater than man’s
ruled the event. The Power that lifted these azure hills, and
spread out the green valleys, and hollowed a passage for the
stream, appointed to treason also a limit and a term. “Thus
far and no farther.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The surrounding country is full of lively reminiscences of
those terrible times. Panic-stricken populations flying at the
approach of the enemy; whole families fugitive from homes
none thought of defending; flocks and herds, horses, wagon-loads
of promiscuously heaped household stuffs and farm produce,—men,
women, children, riding, walking, running, driving
or leading their bewildered four-footed chattels,—all
rushing forward with clamor and alarm under clouds of dust,
crowding every road to the river, and thundering across the
long bridges, regardless of the “five-dollars-fine” notice,
(though it is to be hoped that the toll-takers did their duty;)—such
were the scenes which occurred to render the Rebel
invasion memorable. The thrifty Dutch farmers of the lower
counties did not gain much credit either for courage or patriotism
at that time. It was a panic, however, to which almost
any community would have been liable. Stuart’s famous raid
of the previous year was well remembered. If a small cavalry
force had swept from their track through a circuit of about
sixty miles over two thousand horses, what was to be expected
from Lee’s whole army? Resistance to the formidable
advance of one hundred thousand disciplined troops was of
course out of the question. The slowness, however, with which
the people responded to the State’s almost frantic calls for
volunteers was in singular contrast with the alacrity each man
showed to run off his horses and get his goods out of Rebel
reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Harrisburg I went, by the way of York and Hanover,
to Gettysburg. Having hastily secured a room at a hotel in
the Square, (the citizens call it the “Di’mond,”) I inquired
the way to the battle-ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are on it now,” said the landlord, with proud satisfaction,—for
it is not every man that lives, much less keeps a
tavern, on the field of a world-famous fight. “I tell you the
truth,” said he; and, in proof of his words, (as if the fact were
too wonderful to be believed without proof,) he showed me a
Rebel shell imbedded in the brick wall of a house close by.
(N. B. The battle-field was put into the bill.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Gettysburg is the capital of Adams County: a town of
about three thousand souls,—or fifteen hundred, according to
John Burns, who assured me that half the population were
Copperheads, and that they had no souls. It is pleasantly
situated on the swells of a fine undulating country, drained by
the head-waters of the Monocacy. It has no especial natural
advantages; owing its existence, probably, to the mere fact
that several important roads found it convenient to meet at
this point, to which accident also is due its historical renown.
The circumstance which made it a burg made it likewise a
battle-field.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the town itself there is nothing very interesting. It
consists chiefly of two-story houses of wood and brick, in dull
rows, with thresholds but little elevated above the street.
Rarely a front yard or blooming garden-plot relieves the dreary
monotony. Occasionally there is a three-story house, comfortable,
no doubt, and sufficiently expensive, about which the one
thing remarkable is the total absence of taste in its construction.
In this respect Gettysburg is but a fair sample of a large
class of American towns, the builders of which seem never
once to have been conscious that there exists such a thing as
beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Burns, known as the “hero of Gettysburg,” was
almost the first person whose acquaintance I made. He was
sitting under the thick shade of an English elm in front of
the tavern. The landlord introduced him as “the old man
who took his gun and went into the first day’s fight.” He
rose to his feet and received me with sturdy politeness; his
evident delight in the celebrity he enjoys twinkling through
the veil of a naturally modest demeanor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“John will go with you and show you the different parts of
the battle-ground,” said the landlord. “Will you, John?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, I’ll go,” said John, quite readily; and we set
out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIELD OF GETTYSBURG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A mile south of the town is Cemetery Hill, the head and
front of an important ridge, running two miles farther south to
Round Top,—the ridge held by General Meade’s army during
the great battles. The Rebels attacked on three sides,—on
the west, on the north, and on the east; breaking their forces
in vain upon this tremendous wedge, of which Cemetery Hill
may be considered the point. A portion of Ewell’s Corps had
passed through the town several days before, and neglected to
secure that very commanding position. Was it mere accident,
or something more, which thus gave the key to the country
into our hands, and led the invaders, alarmed by Meade’s
vigorous pursuit, to fall back and fight the decisive battle
here?</p>

<p class='c000'>With the old “hero” at my side pointing out the various
points of interest, I ascended Cemetery Hill. The view from
the top is beautiful and striking. On the north and east is
spread a finely variegated farm country; on the west, with
woods and valleys and sunny slopes between, rise the summits
of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a soft and peaceful summer day. There was scarce
a sound to break the stillness, save the shrill note of the locust,
and the perpetual click-click of the stone-cutters at work upon
the granite headstones of the soldiers’ cemetery. There was
nothing to indicate to a stranger that so tranquil a spot had
ever been a scene of strife. We were walking in the time-hallowed
place of the dead, by whose side the martyr-soldiers
who fought so bravely and so well on those terrible first days
of July, slept as sweetly and securely as they.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“It don’t look here as it did after the battle,” said John
Burns. “Sad work was made with the tombstones. The
ground was all covered with dead horses, and broken wagons,
and pieces of shells, and battered muskets, and everything of
that kind, not to speak of the heaps of dead.” But now the
tombstones have been replaced, the neat iron fences have been
mostly repaired, and scarcely a vestige of the fight remains.
Only the burial-places of the slain are there. <em>Thirty-five hundred
and sixty slaughtered Union soldiers lie on the field of
Gettysburg.</em> This number does not include those whose bodies
have been claimed by friends and removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new cemetery, devoted to the patriot slain, and dedicated
with fitting ceremonies on the 19th of November, 1863,
adjoins the old one. In the centre is the spot reserved for the
monument, the corner-stone of which was laid on the 4th of
July, 1865. The cemetery is semicircular, in the form of an
amphitheatre, except that the slope is reversed, the monument
occupying the highest place. The granite headstones resemble
rows of semicircular seats. Side by side, with two feet of
ground allotted to each, and with their heads towards the
monument, rest the three thousand five hundred and sixty.
The name of each, when it could be ascertained, together with
the number of the company and regiment in which he served,
is lettered on the granite at his head. But the barbarous
practice of stripping such of our dead as fell into their hands,
in which the Rebels indulged here as elsewhere, rendered it
impossible to identify large numbers. The headstones of these
are lettered “Unknown.” At the time when I visited the
cemetery, the sections containing most of the unknown had
not yet received their headstones, and their resting-places
were indicated by a forest of stakes. I have seen few sadder
sights.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spectacle of so large a field crowded with the graves of
the slain brings home to the heart an overpowering sense of
the horror and wickedness of war. Yet, as I have said, not
all our dead are here. None of the Rebel dead are here.
Not one of those who fell on other fields, or died in hospitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and prisons in those States where the war was chiefly waged,—not
one out of those innumerable martyred hosts lies on this
pleasant hill. The bodies of once living and brave men,
slowly mouldering to dust in this sanctified soil, form but a
small, a single sheaf from that great recent harvest reaped by
Death with the sickle of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once living and brave! How full of life, how full of unflinching
courage and fiery zeal they marched up hither to
fight the great fight, and to give their lives! And each man
had his history; each soldier resting here had his interests, his
loves, his darling hopes, the same as you or I. All were laid
down with his life. It was no trifle to him: it was as great a
thing to him as it would be to you, thus to be cut off from all
things dear in this world, and to drop at once into a vague
eternity. Grown accustomed to the waste of life through
years of war, we learn to think too lightly of such sacrifices.
“So many killed,”—with that brief sentence we glide over
the unimaginably fearful fact, and pass on to other details.
We indulge in pious commonplaces,—“They have gone to a
better world; they have their reward,” and the like. No
doubt this is true; if not, then life is a mockery, and hope a
lie. But the future, with all our faith, is vague and uncertain.
It lies before us like one of those unidentified heroes,
hidden from sight, deep-buried, mysterious, its headstone lettered
“Unknown.” Will it ever rise? Through trouble,
toils, and privations,—not insensible to danger, but braving it,—these
men—and not these only, but the uncounted thousands
represented by these—confronted, for their country’s
sake, that awful uncertainty. Did they believe in your better
world? Whether they did or not, this world was a reality,
and dear to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked into one of the trenches, in which workmen were
laying foundations for the headstones, and saw the ends of the
coffins protruding. It was silent and dark down there. Side
by side the soldiers slept, as side by side they fought. I
chose out one coffin from among the rest, and thought of him
whose dust it contained,—your brother and mine, although
we never knew him. I thought of him as a child, tenderly
reared up—for this. I thought of his home, his heart-life:—</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not know; in this world, none will ever know. He
sleeps with the undistinguishable multitude, and his headstone
is lettered “Unknown.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Eighteen loyal States are represented by the tenants of
these graves. New York has the greatest number,—upwards
of eight hundred; Pennsylvania comes next in order,
having upwards of five hundred. Tall men from Maine,
young braves from Wisconsin, heroes from every State between,
met here to defend their country and their homes.
Sons of Massachusetts fought for Massachusetts on Pennsylvania
soil. If they had not fought, or if our armies had been
annihilated here, the whole North would have been at the
mercy of Lee’s victorious legions. As Cemetery Hill was the
pivot on which turned the fortunes of the battle, so Gettysburg
itself was the pivot on which turned the destiny of the
nation. Here the power of aggressive treason culminated;
and from that memorable Fourth of July, when the Rebel invaders,
beaten in the three days’ previous fight, stole away
down the valleys and behind the mountains on their ignominious
retreat,—from that day, signalized also by the fall of
Vicksburg in the West, it waned and waned, until it was
swept from the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cemetery Hill should be first visited by the tourist of the
battle-ground. Here a view of the entire field, and a clear
understanding of the military operations of the three days, are
best obtained. Looking north, away on your left lies Seminary
Ridge, the scene of the first day’s fight, in which the gallant
Reynolds fell, and from which our troops were driven back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>in confusion through the town by overwhelming numbers in
the afternoon. Farther south spread the beautiful woods and
vales that swarmed with Rebels on the second and third day,
and from which they made such desperate charges upon our
lines. On the right as you stand is Culp’s Hill, the scene of
Ewell’s furious but futile attempts to flank us there. You are
in the focus of a half-circle, from all points of which was poured
in upon this now silent hill such an artillery fire as has seldom
been concentrated upon one point of an open field in any of
the great battles upon this planet. From this spot extend your
observations as you please.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guided by the sturdy old man, I proceeded first to Culp’s
Hill, following a line of breastworks into the woods. Here are
seen some of the soldiers’ devices, hastily adopted for defence.
A rude embankment of stakes and logs and stones, covered
with earth, forms the principal work; aside from which you
meet with little private breastworks, as it were, consisting of
rocks heaped up by the trunk of a tree, or beside a larger rock,
or across a cleft in the rocks, where some sharpshooter stood
and exercised his skill at his ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The woods are of oak chiefly, but with a liberal sprinkling
of chestnut, black-walnut, hickory, and other common forest-trees.
Very beautiful they were that day, with their great,
silent trunks, all so friendly, their clear vistas and sun-spotted
spaces. Beneath reposed huge, sleepy ledges and boulders,
their broad backs covered with lichens and old moss. A more
fitting spot for a picnic, one would say, than for a battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet here remain more astonishing evidences of fierce fighting
than anywhere else about Gettysburg. The trees in certain
localities are all scarred, disfigured, and literally dying or
dead from their wounds. The marks of balls in some of the
trunks are countless. Here are limbs, and yonder are whole
tree-tops, cut off by shells. Many of these trees have been
hacked for lead, and chips containing bullets have been carried
away for relics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Past the foot of the hill runs Rock Creek, a muddy, sluggish
stream, “great for eels,” said John Burns. Big boulders and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>blocks of stone lie scattered along its bed. Its low shores are
covered with thin grass, shaded by the forest-trees. Plenty of
Rebel knapsacks and haversacks lie rotting upon the ground;
and there are Rebel graves near by in the woods. By these I
was inclined to pause longer than John Burns thought it worth
the while. I felt a pity for these unhappy men, which he could
not understand. To him they were dead Rebels, and nothing
more; and he spoke with great disgust of an effort which had
been made by certain “Copperheads” of the town to have all
the buried Rebels now scattered about in the woods and fields
gathered together in a cemetery near that dedicated to our own
dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet consider, my friend,” I said, “though they were
altogether in the wrong, and their cause was infernal, these,
too, were brave men; and, under different circumstances, with
no better hearts than they had, they might have been lying in
honored graves up yonder, instead of being buried in heaps,
like dead cattle, down here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Is there not a better future for these men also? The time
will come when we shall at least cease to hate them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cicada was singing, insects were humming in the air,
crows were cawing in the tree-tops, the sunshine slept on the
boughs or nestled in the beds of brown leaves on the ground,—all
so pleasant and so pensive, I could have passed the day
there. But John reminded me that night was approaching,
and we returned to Gettysburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening I walked alone to Cemetery Hill, to see the
sun set behind the Blue Ridge. A quiet prevailed there still
more profound than during the day. The stone-cutters had
finished their day’s work and gone home. The katydids were
singing, and the shrill, sad chirp of the crickets welcomed the
cool shades. The sun went down, and the stars came out and
shone upon the graves,—the same stars which were no doubt
shining even then upon many a vacant home and mourning
heart left lonely by the husbands, the fathers, the dear brothers
and sons, who fell at Gettysburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, according to agreement, I went to call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>on the old hero. I found him living in the upper part of a
little whitewashed two-story house, on the corner of two streets
west of the town. A flight of wooden steps outside took me
to his door. He was there to welcome me. John Burns is a
stoutish, slightly bent, hale old man, with a light-blue eye, a
long, aggressive nose, a firm-set mouth expressive of determination
of character, and a choleric temperament. His hair,
originally dark-brown, is considerably bleached with age; and
his beard, once sandy, covers his face (shaved once or twice a
week) with a fine crop of silver stubble. A short, massy kind
of man; about five feet four or five inches in height, I should
judge. He was never measured but once in his life. That
was when he enlisted in the War of 1812. He was then
nineteen years old, and stood five feet in his shoes. “But
I’ve growed a heap since,” said John.</p>

<p class='c000'>At my request he told his story.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the first day’s fight he sent his wife
away, telling her that he would take care of the house. The
firing was near by, over Seminary Ridge. Soon a wounded
soldier came into the town and stopped at an old house on the
opposite corner. Burns saw the poor fellow lay down his
musket, and the inspiration to go into the battle seems then
first to have seized him. He went over and demanded the
gun.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you going to do with it?” asked the soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going to shoot some of the damned Rebels!” replied
John.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is not a swearing man, and the strong adjective is to be
taken in a strictly literal, not a profane, sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having obtained the gun, he pushed out on the Chambersburg
Pike, and was soon in the thick of the skirmish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wore a high-crowned hat and a long-tailed blue; and I
was seventy year old.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight of so old a man, in such costume, rushing fearlessly
forward to get a shot in the very front of the battle, of
course attracted attention. He fought with the Seventh Wisconsin
Regiment; the Colonel of which ordered him back, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>questioned him, and finally, seeing the old man’s patriotic
determination, gave him a good rifle in place of the musket he
had brought with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you a good shot?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tolerable good,” said John, who is an old fox-hunter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you see that Rebel riding yonder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you fetch him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The old man took deliberate aim and fired. He does not say
he killed the Rebel, but simply that his shot was cheered by
the Wisconsin boys, and that afterwards the horse the Rebel
rode was seen galloping with an empty saddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s all I know about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He fought until our forces were driven back in the afternoon.
He had already received two slight wounds, and a third
one through the arm, to which he paid little attention; “only
the blood running down my hand bothered me a heap.”
Then, as he was slowly falling back with the rest, he received
a final shot through the leg. “Down I went, and the whole
Rebel army run over me.” Helpless, nearly bleeding to death
from his wounds, he lay upon the field all night. “About
sun-up, next morning, I crawled to a neighbor’s house, and
found it full of wounded Rebels.” The neighbor afterwards
took him to his own house, which had also been turned into a
Rebel hospital. A Rebel surgeon dressed his wounds; and he
says he received decent treatment at the hands of the enemy,
until a Copperhead woman living opposite “told on him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the old man who said he was going out to shoot
some of the damned Rebels!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some officers came and questioned him, endeavoring to convict
him of bushwhacking. But the old man gave them little
satisfaction. This was on Friday, the third day of the battle;
and he was alone with his wife in the upper part of the house.
The Rebels left; and soon after two shots were fired. One
bullet entered the window, passed over Burns’s head, and
penetrated the wall behind the lounge on which he was lying.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The other shot fell lower, passing through a door. Burns is
certain that the design was to assassinate him. That the shots
were fired by the Rebels there can be no doubt; and as they
were fired from their own side, towards the town, of which
they held possession at the time, John’s theory seems the true
one. The hole in the window, and the bullet-marks in the
door and wall, remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burns went with me over the ground where the first day’s
fight took place. He showed me the scene of his hot day’s
work,—pointed out two trees behind which he and one of
the Wisconsin boys stood and “picked off every Rebel that
showed his head,” and the spot where he fell and lay all night
under the stars and dew.</p>

<p class='c000'>This act of daring on the part of so aged a citizen, and his
subsequent sufferings from wounds, naturally called out a great
deal of sympathy, and caused him to be looked upon as a hero.
But a hero, like a prophet, has not all honor in his own
country. There is a wide-spread, violent prejudice against
Burns among that class of the townspeople termed “Copperheads.”
The young men especially, who did not take their
guns and go into the fight as this old man did, but who ran,
when running was possible, in the opposite direction, dislike
Burns; some averring that he did not have a gun in his hand
that day, but that he was wounded by accident, happening to
get between the two lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of his going into the fight and <em>fighting</em>, there is no doubt
whatever. Of his bravery, amounting even to rashness, there
can be no reasonable question. He is a patriot of the most
zealous sort; a hot, impulsive man, who meant what he said
when he started with the gun to go and shoot some of the
Rebels qualified with the strong adjective. A thoroughly
honest man, too, I think; although some of his remarks are to
be taken with considerable allowance. His temper causes him
to form immoderate opinions and to make strong statements.
“<em>He always goes beyant</em>,” said my landlord.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burns is a sagacious observer of men and things, and makes
occasionally such shrewd remarks as this:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Whenever you see the marks of shells and bullets on a
house all covered up, and painted and plastered over, that’s
the house of a Rebel sympathizer. But when you see them
all preserved and kept in sight, as something to be proud of,
that’s the house of a true Union man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, whatever is said or thought of the old hero, he is <em>what
he is</em>, and has satisfaction in that, and not in other people’s
opinions; for so it must finally be with all. <em>Character</em> is the
one thing valuable. <em>Reputation</em>, which is a mere shadow of
the man, what his character is <em>reputed</em> to be, is, in the long run,
of infinitely less importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am happy to add that the old man has been awarded a
pension.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day I mounted a hard-trotting horse and rode to
Round Top. On the way I stopped at the historical peach-orchard,
known as Sherfy’s, where Sickles’s Corps was repulsed,
after a terrific conflict, on Thursday, the second day of
the battle. The peaches were green on the trees then; but
they were ripe now, and the branches were breaking down with
them. One of Mr. Sherfy’s girls—the youngest she told me—was
in the orchard. She had in her basket rareripes to
sell. They were large and juicy and sweet,—all the redder,
no doubt, for the blood of the brave that had drenched the sod.
So calm and impassive is Nature, silently turning all things to
use. The carcass of a mule, or the godlike shape of a warrior
cut down in the hour of glory,—she knows no difference
between them, but straightway proceeds to convert both alike
into new forms of life and beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between fields made memorable by hard fighting I rode,
eastward, and, entering a pleasant wood, ascended Little
Round Top. The eastern slope of this rugged knob is covered
with timber. The western side is steep, and wild with rocks
and bushes. Near by is the Devil’s Den, a dark cavity in the
rocks, interesting henceforth on account of the fight that took
place here for the possession of these heights. A photographic
view, taken the Sunday morning after the battle, shows eight
dead Rebels tumbled headlong, with their guns, among the
rocks below the Den.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>A little farther on is Round Top itself, a craggy tusk of the
rock-jawed earth pushed up there towards the azure. It is
covered all over with broken ledges, boulders, and fields of
stones. Among these the forest-trees have taken root,—thrifty
Nature making the most of things even here. The
serene leafy tops of ancient oaks tower aloft in the bluish-golden
air. It is a natural fortress, which our boys strengthened
still further by throwing up the loose stones into handy
breastworks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning, I rode the whole length of the ridge held by our
troops, realizing more and more the importance of that extraordinary
position. It is like a shoe, of which Round Top
represents the heel, and Cemetery Hill the toe. Here all our
forces were concentrated on Thursday and Friday, within a
space of two miles. Movements from one part to another of
this compact field could be made with celerity. Lee’s forces,
on the other hand, extended over a circle of seven miles or
more around, in a country where all their movements could be
watched by us and anticipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a point well forward on the foot of this shoe, Meade had
his head-quarters. I tied my horse at the gate, and entered the
little square box of a house which enjoys that historical celebrity.
It is scarcely more than a hut, having but two little
rooms on the ground-floor, and I know not what narrow, low-roofed
chambers above. Two small girls, with brown German
faces, were paring wormy apples under the porch; and a
round-shouldered, bareheaded, and barefooted woman, also with
a German face and a strong German accent, was drawing
water at the well. I asked her for drink, which she kindly
gave me, and invited me into the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little box was whitewashed outside and in, except the
floor and ceilings and inside doors, which were neatly scoured.
The woman sat down to some mending, and entered freely
into conversation. She was a widow, and the mother of six
children. The two girls cutting wormy apples at the door
were the youngest, and the only ones left to her. A son in
the army was expected home in a few days. She did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>know how old her children were; she did not know how old
she was herself, “she was so forgetful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She ran away at the time of the fight, but was sorry afterwards
she did not stay at home. “She lost a heap.” The
house was robbed of almost everything; “coverlids and sheets,
and some of our own clo’es, all carried away. They got about
two ton of hay from me. I owed a little on my land yit, and
thought I’d put in two lots of wheat that year, and it was all
trampled down, and I didn’t git nothing from it. I had seven
pieces of meat yit, and them was all took. All I had when I
got back was jist a little bit of flour yit. The fences was all
tore down, so that there wa’n’t one standing, and the rails
was burnt up. One shell come into the house and knocked a
bedstead all to pieces for me. One come in under the roof
and knocked out a rafter for me. The porch was all knocked
down. There was seventeen dead horses on my land. They
burnt five of ’em around my best peach-tree, and killed it; so
I ha’n’t no peaches this year. They broke down all my young
apple-trees for me. The dead horses sp’iled my spring, so I
had to have my well dug.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired if she had ever got anything for the damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not much. I jist sold the bones of the dead horses. I
couldn’t do it till this year, for the meat hadn’t rotted off yit.
I got fifty cents a hundred. There was seven hundred and
fifty pounds. You can reckon up what they come to. That’s
all I got.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Not much, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'>This poor woman’s entire interest in the great battle was, I
found, centred in her own losses. What the country lost or
gained, she did not know nor care, never having once thought
of that side of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town is full of similar reminiscences; and it is a subject
which everybody except the “Copperheads” likes to talk with
you about. There were heroic women here, too. On the
evening of Wednesday, as our forces were retreating, an exhausted
Union soldier came to Mr. Culp’s house, near Culp’s
Hill, and said, as he sank down,—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“If I can’t have a drink of water, I must die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Culp, who had taken refuge in the cellar,—for the
house was now between the two fires,—said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will go to the spring and get you some water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then nearly dark. As she was returning with the
water, a bullet whizzed past her. It was fired by a sharpshooter
on our own side, who had mistaken her for one of the advancing
Rebels. Greatly frightened, she hurried home, bringing
the water safely. One poor soldier was made eternally grateful
by this courageous, womanly deed. A few days later the
sharpshooter came to the house and learned that it was a
ministering angel in the guise of a woman he had shot at.
Great, also, must have been his gratitude for the veil of darkness
which caused him to miss his aim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after the battle, sad tales were told of the cruel inhospitality
shown to the wounded Union troops by the people
of Gettysburg. Many of these stories were doubtless true;
but they were true only of the more brutal of the Rebel
sympathizers. The Union men threw open their hearts and
their houses to the wounded. One afternoon I met a soldier
on Cemetery Hill, who was in the battle; and who, being at
Harrisburg for a few days, had taken advantage of an excursion
train to come over and revisit the scene of that terrible
experience. Getting into conversation, we walked down the
hill together. As we were approaching a double house with
high wooden steps, he pointed out the farther one, and said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Saturday morning, after the fight, I got a piece of bread at
that house. A man stood on the steps and gave each of our
fellows a piece. We were hungry as bears, and it was a godsend.
I should like to see that man and thank him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the man himself appeared at the door. We went
over, and I introduced the soldier, who, with tears in his eyes,
expressed his gratitude for that act of Christian charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the man, when reminded of the circumstance,
“we did what we could. We baked bread here night and
day to give to every hungry soldier who wanted it. We sent
away our own children, to make room for the wounded soldiers,
and for days our house was a hospital.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Instances of this kind are not few. Let them be remembered
to the honor of Gettysburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the magnitude of a battle fought so desperately during
three days, by armies numbering not far from two hundred
thousand men, no adequate conception can be formed. One
or two facts may help to give a faint idea of it. Mr. Culp’s
meadow, below Cemetery Hill,—a lot of near twenty acres,—was
so thickly strown with Rebel dead, that Mr. Culp declared
he “could have walked across it without putting foot
upon the ground.” Upwards of three hundred Confederates
were buried in that fair field in one hole. On Mr. Gwynn’s
farm, below Round Top, near five hundred sons of the South
lie promiscuously heaped in one huge sepulchre. Of the quantities
of iron, of the wagon-loads of arms, knapsacks, haversacks,
and clothing, which strewed the country, no estimate
can be made. Government set a guard over these, and for
weeks officials were busy in gathering together all the more
valuable spoils. The harvest of bullets was left for the citizens
to glean. Many of the poorer people did a thriving business
picking up these missiles of death, and selling them to
dealers; two of whom alone sent to Baltimore fifty tons of
lead collected in this way from the battle-field.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>A REMINISCENCE OF CHAMBERSBURG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Friday afternoon, August 18th, I left Gettysburg for
Chambersburg, by stage, over a rough turnpike, which had
been broken to pieces by Lee’s artillery and army wagons two
years before, and had not since been repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>We traversed a sleepy-looking wheat and corn country,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wherein it seemèd always afternoon,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>so little stir was there, so few signs of life and enterprise were
visible. Crossing the Blue Ridge, we passed through a more
busy land later in the day, and entered the pleasant suburbs
of Chambersburg at sunset.</p>

<p class='c000'>The few scattered residences east of the railroad were soon
passed, however, and we came upon scenes which quickly reminded
us that we had entered a doomed and desolated place.
On every side were the skeletons of houses burned by the
Rebels but a little more than a year before. We looked across
their roofless and broken walls, and through the sightless
windows, at the red sunset sky. They stared at us with their
empty eye-sockets, and yawned at us with their fanged and
jagged jaws. Dead shade-trees stood solemn in the dusk
beside the dead, deserted streets. In places, the work of rebuilding
had been vigorously commenced; and the streets were
to be traversed only by narrow paths between piles of old brick
saved from the ruins, stacks of new brick, beds of mortar, and
heaps of sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our driver took us to a new hotel erected on the ruins of
an old one. The landlord, eager to talk upon the exciting
subject, told me his story while supper was preparing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“I had jeest bought the hotel that stood where this does,
and paid eight thousand dollars for it. I had laid out two
thousand dollars fitting it up. All the rooms had been new
papered and furnished, and there was three hundred dollars’
worth of carpets in the house not put down yet, when the
Rebels they jeest come in and burnt it all up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was spoken with a look and tone which showed what a
real and terrible thing the disaster was to this man, far different
from the trifle it appears on paper. I found everybody
full of talk on this great and absorbing topic. On the night
of July 29th, 1864, the Rebel cavalry appeared before the
town. Some artillery boys went out with a field-piece to
frighten them, and fired a few shots. That kept the raiders
at bay till morning; for they had come, not to fight, but to
destroy; and it was ticklish advancing in the dark, with the
suggestive field-piece flashing at them. The next morning,
however, quite early, before the alarmed inhabitants had
thought of breakfast, they entered,—the field-piece keeping
judiciously out of sight. They had come with General Early’s
orders to burn the town, in retaliation for General Hunter’s
spoliation of the Shenandoah Valley. That they would commit
so great a crime was hardly to be credited; for what
Hunter had done towards destroying that granary of the Confederacy
had been done as a military necessity, and there was
no such excuse for burning Chambersburg. It seemed a folly
as well as a crime; for, with our armies occupying the South,
and continually acquiring new districts and cities, it was in
their power, had they been equally barbarous, to take up and
carry on this game of retaliation until the whole South should
have become as Sodom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chambersburg had suffered from repeated Rebel raids, but it
had escaped serious damage, and the people were inclined to
jeer at those neighboring towns which had been terrified into
paying heavy ransoms to the marauders. But now its time
had come. The Confederate leaders demanded of the authorities
one hundred thousand dollars in gold, or five hundred
thousand dollars in United States currency; promising that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>if the money was not forthcoming in fifteen minutes, the torch
would be applied. I know not whether it was possible to raise
so great a sum in so short a time. At all events, it was not
raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then suddenly from all parts of the town went up a cry of
horror and dismay. The infernal work had begun. The
town was fired in a hundred places at once. A house was
entered, a can of kerosene emptied on a bed, and in an instant
up went a burst of flame. Extensive plundering was
done. Citizens were told that if they would give their
money their houses would be spared. The money was in
many instances promptly given, when their houses were as
promptly fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a wail of women and children, fleeing for life from
their flaming houses, has been seldom heard. Down the hardened
cheeks of old men who could scarce remember that they
had ever wept, the tears ran in streams. In the terrible confusion
nothing was saved. In many houses money, which had
been carefully put away, was abandoned and burned. The
heat of the flames was fearful. Citizens who described those
scenes to me considered it miraculous that in the midst of so
great terror and excitement, with the town in flames on all
sides at once, not a life was lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The part of the town east of the railroad is said to have been
saved by the presence of mind and greatness of spirit of a
heroic lady. As her house was about to be fired, she appealed
to a cavalry captain, and, showing him the throngs of weeping
and wailing women and children seeking refuge in the cut
through which the railroad passes, said to him, with solemn
emphasis,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the day of judgment, sir, you will see that sight again;
then, sir, you will have this to answer for!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain was touched. “It is contrary to orders,” said
he, “but this thing shall be stopped.” And he stationed a
guard along the track to prevent further destruction of the
city in that direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The homeless citizens crowded to a hill and watched from its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>summit the completion of the diabolical work. The whirlwind
of fire and smoke that went roaring up into the calm,
blue heavens, soon over-canopied by one vast cloud, was indescribably
appalling. Fortunately the day was still, otherwise
not a house would have been left standing. As it was,
three hundred and forty houses were burned, comprising about
two thirds of the entire town.</p>

<p class='c000'>The raiders were evidently afraid of being caught at the
work. The smoke, which could be seen thirty or forty miles
away, would doubtless prove a pillar of cloud to guide our
cavalry to the spot. Having hastily accomplished their task,
therefore, with equal haste they decamped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three of their number, however, paid the penalty of the
crime on the spot. Two, plundering a cellar, were shot by a
redoubtable apothecary,—a choleric but conscientious man,
who was much troubled in his mind afterwards for what he had
done; for it is an awful thing to take human life even under
circumstances the most justifiable. “He was down-hearted
all the next day about it,” said one. In the meanwhile the
dead marauders were roasted and broiled, and reduced to
indistinguishable ashes, in the pyre they had themselves prepared.</p>

<p class='c000'>A major of the party, who had become intoxicated plundering
the liquor-shops, lingered behind his companions. He
was surrounded by the incensed populace and ordered to surrender.
Refusing, and drawing his sword with maudlin threats,
he was shot down. He was then buried to his breast outside
of the town, and left with just his shoulders protruding from
the ground, with his horrible lolling head drooping over them.
Having been exhibited in this state to the multitude, many
of whom, no doubt, found some comfort in the sight, he was
granted a more thorough sepulture. A few weeks before my
visit to the place, a gentle-faced female from the South came
to claim his body; for he, too, was a human being, and no
mere monster, as many supposed, and there were those that
did love him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distress and suffering of the burnt-out inhabitants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Chambersburg can never be told. “For six weeks they were
jeest kept alive by the provisions sent by other towns, which
we dealt out here to every one that asked,” said my landlord.
“And I declare to fortune,” he added, “there was scoundrels
from the outside that hadn’t lost a thing, that would come in
here and share with our starving people.” These scoundrels,
he said, were Germans, and he was very severe upon them,
although he himself had a German name, and a German accent
which three generations of his race in this country had
not entirely eradicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the charity of the towns, the State granted one
hundred thousand dollars for the relief of the sufferers. This
was but as a drop to them. Those who had property remaining
got nothing. The appropriation was intended for those
who had lost everything,—and there were hundreds of such;
some of whom had been stopped in the streets and robbed even
of their shoes, after their houses had been fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was jeest how it worked. Some got more than they
had before the fire. A boarding-house girl that had lost say
eight dollars, would come and say she had lost fifty, and she’d
get fifty. But men like me, that happened to have a little
property outside, never got a cent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It will always remain a matter of astonishment that the great
and prosperous State of Pennsylvania did not make a more
generous appropriation. The tax necessary for the purpose
would scarcely have been felt by any one, while it would have
been but a just indemnification to those who had suffered in
a cause which the whole loyal North was bound to uphold.
Families enjoying a small competency had been at once
reduced to poverty; men doing a modest and comfortable
business were unable to resume it. Those who could obtain
credit before could now obtain none. Insurance was
void. Householders were unable to rebuild, and at the time
of my visit many were still living in shanties. Nearly all
the rebuilding that was in progress was done on borrowed
capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there is no loss without gain. Chambersburg will in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the end be greatly benefited by the fire, inasmuch as the old
two-story buildings, of which the town was originally composed,
are being replaced by three-story houses, much finer and more
commodious. So let it be with our country; fearful as our
loss has been, we shall build better anew.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>SOUTH MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The next day I took the cars for Hagerstown; passed Sunday
in that slow and ancient burg; and early on Monday
morning set out by stage for Boonsboro’.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our course lay down the valley of the Antietam. We
crossed the stream at Funk’s Town, a little over two miles
from Hagerstown. “Stop at two miles and you won’t be
here,” said the driver. The morning was fine; the air fresh
and inspiring; and the fact that the country through which
we passed had been fought over repeatedly during the war,
added interest to the ride. A fertile valley: on each side were
fields of tall and stalwart corn. Lusty milkweeds stood by
the fences; the driver called them “wild cotton.” And here
the Jamestown-weed, with its pointed leaves, and flower
resembling the bell of a morning-glory, became abundant.
“That’s <em>jimson</em>,” said the driver; and he proceeded to extol
its medicinal qualities. “Makes a good sa’v’. Rub that over
a hoss, and I bet ye no fly lights on him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At Boonsboro’ some time was consumed in finding a conveyance
and a guide to take me over the battle-fields. At
length I encountered Lewy Smith, light and jaunty Lewy
Smith, with his light and jaunty covered carryall,—whom
I would recommend to travellers. I engaged him for the
afternoon of that day and for the day following; and immediately
after dinner he was at the tavern-door, snapping his
whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The traveller’s most pleasant experience of Boonsboro’ is
leaving it. The town contains about nine hundred inhabitants;
and the wonder is how so many human souls can rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>content to live in such a mouldy, lonesome place. But once
outside of it, you find Nature as busy in making the world
beautiful, as man inside has been in making it as ugly as possible.
A country village carries with it the idea of something
pleasant, shady, green; therefore do not think of Boonsboro’
as a country village. Leave it behind you as soon as convenient,
and turn your face to the mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>That is the famed South Mountain, where the prologue to
the Antietam fight was enacted. “I never heard it called
<em>South Mountain</em> till after the battle,” said Lewy Smith. “It
was always the <em>Blue Ridge</em> with us.” He had never heard of
Turner’s Gap, or Frog Gap, either. “We always called it just
the gap in the mountain.” The road to the gap runs southeast
from Boonsboro’, then turns easterly up the hills. It stretched
long and pleasant before us. “The night before the battle,” said
Lewy Smith, “this road was lined with Rebels, I tell ye! Both
sides were covered with them about as thick as they could lie.
It was a great sight to see so many soldiers; and it didn’t
seem to us there were men enough in the Union army to fight
them. We thought the Rebels had got possession of Maryland,
sure. They just went into our stores and took what they
pleased, and paid in Confederate money; they had come to
stay, they said, and their money would be better than ours
in a little while. Some who got plenty of it did well; for
when the Rebels slaughtered a drove of cattle, they would
sell the hides and take their own currency for pay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The mountain rose before us, leopard-colored, spotted with
sun and cloud. A few mean log houses were scattered along
the road, near the summit of which we came to the Mountain
House, a place of summer resort. Here again man had
done his best to defeat the aim of Nature; the house and
everything about it looked dreary and forbidding, while all
around lay the beautiful mountain in its wild forest-shades.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lewy left his horse at the stable, and we entered the woods,
pursuing a mountain-road which runs south along the crest.
A tramp of twenty minutes brought us to the scene of General
Reno’s brilliant achievement and heroic death. A rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>stone set up in the field, near a spreading chestnut, marks the
spot where he fell. A few rods north of this, running east
and west, is the mountain-road, with a stone wall on each side
of it, where the Rebels fought furiously, until driven out from
their defences by our boys coming up through the woods.
The few wayside trees are riddled with bullets. A little
higher up the crest is a log house, and a well in which fifty-seven
dead Rebels are buried. “The owner of the house was
offered a dollar a head for burying them. The easiest way
he could do was to pitch them into the well. But he don’t
like to own up to having done it now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a sunny, breezy field. “Up yer’s a heap of air
sturrin’,” said a mountaineer, whom we met coming up the
road. We sat down and talked with him by the stone wall;
and he told us of his tribulations and mishaps on the day of
the battle, attempting to fly south over the mountain with his
family; overloading his wagon, and breaking down just as
the shells began to explode around him; doing everything
“wrong-eend fust, he was so skeered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We pushed along through the woods to the eastern brow
of the crest, in order to obtain a general view of the field.
Emerging from among the trees, a superb scene opened before
us,—Catoctin Valley, like a poem in blue and gold, with
its patches of hazy woods, sunlit misty fields, and the Catoctin
Mountains rolling up ethereal beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridge across Catoctin Creek, half a mile west of Middletown,
where the fighting began on that memorable Sunday,
September 14th, 1862, could be seen half hidden and far
away below. There our troops came up with the rear-guard
of the invading army. Driven back from the Creek, the
Rebels massed their forces and formed their line of battle, two
miles in extent, on this mountain-side, in positions of formidable
strength. Standing on the brow of the commanding crest,
you would say that ten thousand men, rightly posted, might
here check the advance of ten times their number, hold the
gap on the left there, and prevent the steep mountain-sides
from being scaled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>In a barren pasture above the slope climbed by Reno’s men
in face of the Rebel fire, we came upon a little row of graves
under some locust-trees. I took note of a few names lettered
on the humble head-boards. “John Dunn;” “T. G. Dixon,
Co. C, 23d Regt. O. V. I.;” several more were of the 23d Ohio,—the
impetuous regiment that had that day its famous hand-to-hand
conflict with the 23d South Carolina, in which each man
fought as though the honor of the nation depended upon his
individual arm. Here lay the victorious fallen. A few had
been removed from their rude graves. The head-boards of
others had been knocked down by cows. We set them up
again, and left the field to the pensive sound of the cow-bells
and the teasing song of the locust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walking back to the road through the gap, and surveying
the crests flanking and commanding it, which were held by the
Rebels, but carried with irresistible impetuosity by the men of
Burnside’s and Hooker’s corps, one is still more astonished by
the successful issue of that terrible day’s work. All along
these heights rebel and loyal dead lie buried in graves scarcely
distinguishable from each other. Long after the battle, explorers
of the woods were accustomed to find, in hollows and
behind logs, the remains of some poor fellow, generally a Rebel,
who, wounded in the fight, or on the retreat, had dragged
himself to such shelter as he could find, and died there, alone,
uncared for, in the gloomy and silent wilderness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crampton’s Gap, six miles farther south, stormed and carried
that same Sabbath day by the men of Franklin’s corps, I did
not visit. The sun was setting as we turned our faces westward;
and all the way down the mountain we had the Antietam
valley before us, darkening and darkening under a sky
full of the softest twilight tints and tranquillity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIELD OF ANTIETAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At seven o’clock the next morning, light and jaunty Lewy
Smith was snapping his whip again at the tavern-door; and I
was soon riding out of the village by his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our course lay along the line of the Rebel retreat and of the
advance of the right wing of our army. A pleasant road,
under the edge of woods still wet with recent rain, brought us
to Keedysville, a little cluster of brick and log houses, all of
which, Lewy told me, were turned into hospitals after the great
battle. At the farther end of the town is a brick church.
“That was a hospital too. Many an arm, a leg, a hand, was
left there by our boys. There’s a pit behind the church, five
feet long, five feet deep, and two feet wide, just full of legs
and arms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode on until we obtained a view of the pleasant hill-sides
where Porter lay with his reserves, while the other army-corps
did the fighting, on the day of Antietam; then turned
to the right down a little stream, and past a dam, the waters
of which glided still and shadowy under fringed banks; and
soon came in sight of the fields where the great fight began.
There they lay, over the farther bank of the Antietam, some
green, some ploughed, the latter turning up yellow as ripe
grain in the morning light.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We used to could drive all over this country where we
pleased. The fences were laid down, and it was all trampled
and cut up with the wagons, and soldiers, and artillery.” But
the fences had been replaced, and now Lewy was obliged to
keep the open road.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a turn we came to a farm-house, near which were a
number of dilapidated barns and other outbuildings, and some
old straw stacks. “It was a sight to behold, passing yer after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the battle!” said Lewy Smith, shaking his head sadly at the
reminiscence. “All in and around these yer buildings, all
around the hay-stacks, and under the fences, it was just nothing
but groaning, wounded men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Crossing the yellow-flowing Antietam, we turned up the
right bank, with its wooded shores on our right, and on our
left a large cornfield containing not less than forty or fifty
acres. “There was right smart o’ corn all through yer time
of the battle. Good for the armies, but not for the farmers.
Come to a cornfield like this, they just turned their horses and
cattle right into it, and let ’em eat.” You fortunate farmers
of the North and West, so proud and so careful of your well-tilled
fields never yet broken into in this ruinous fashion, have
you fully realized what war is?</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the course of the creek, and crossing the fields
where the fighting on our extreme right began, we reached
a still and shady grove, beside which, fenced in from a field,
was a little oblong burying-ground of something like half an
acre. In the centre was a plain wooden monument constructed
of boards painted white; the pedestal bearing this
inscription:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Let no man desecrate this burial-place of our dead</em>;”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the side of the shaft, towards the fence, these words:</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the hospital cemetery. The graves were close
together in little rows running across the narrow field. They
were all overgrown with grass and weeds. Each was marked
by a small rounded head-board, painted white, and bearing the
name of the soldier sleeping below. Here is one out of the
number:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_045.jpg' alt='E. G. POOLE, Co. G. 12th Mass. Died Oct 14th, 1862.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>As I wrote down this name, the hens in the farm-yard near
by were cackling jubilantly. The clouds broke also; a shaft
of sunlight fell upon the glistening foliage of the grove, and
slanted down through its beautiful vistas. I looked up from
the sad rows of patriot graves, and saw the earth around me,
all around and above the silent mouldering bodies of the slain,
smiling sweetly through her misty veil. For Nature will not
mourn. Nature, serene, majestic, full of faith, makes haste
to cover the wounds in the Earth’s fair bosom, and to smile
upon them. The graves in our hearts also, which we deemed
forever desolate, she clothes with the tender verdure of reviving
hope before we are aware, and gilds them with the sunshine
of a new love and joy. Blessed be our provident mother
for this sweet law, but for which the homes in the land, bereft
by these countless deaths in hospitals and on bloody fields,
would lie draped in endless mourning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the monument, in the midst of the level burying-place,
grew a loftily nodding poke-weed, the monarch of his tribe.
It was more like a tree than a weed. With its roots down
among the graves, and its hundred hands stretched on high,
it stood like another monument, holding up to heaven, for a
sign, its berries of dark blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuing a road along the ridge in a southwesterly direction,
Lewy at length reined up his horse in another peaceful
little grove. Without a word he pointed to the rotting knapsacks
and haversacks on the ground, and to the scarred trees.
I knew the spot; it was the boundary of the bloody “cornfield.”
We had approached from the side on which our boys
advanced to that frightful conflict, driving the Rebels before
them, and being driven back in turn, in horrible seesaw, until
superior Northern pluck and endurance finally prevailed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a field beside the grove we saw a man ploughing, with
three horses abreast, and a young lad for escort. We noticed
loose head-boards, overturned by the plough, on the edge of
the grove, and lying half imbedded in the furrows. This
man was ploughing over graves!</p>

<p class='c000'>Adjoining the field was the historic cornfield. I walked
to the edge of it, and waited there for the man to turn his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>long slow furrow down that way. I sat upon the fence, near
which was a trench filled with unnumbered Rebel dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A power of ’em in this yer field!” said the ploughman,
coming up and looking over as I questioned him. “A heap
of Union soldiers too, layin’ all about yer. I always skip a
Union grave when I know it, but sometimes I don’t see ’em,
and I plough ’em up. Eight or ten thousand lays on this farm,
Rebels and Union together.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding him honest and communicative, I wished him to
go over the ground with me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would willingly, stranger, but I must keep the team
go’n’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I suggested that the boy was big enough to do that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wal, he kin. Plough round onct,”—to the boy,—“or
let ’em blow, tain’t go’n’ to hurt ’em none.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So he concluded to accompany me. We got over into the
“cornfield,” late a hog-pasture, and presently stopped at a
heap of whitening bones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s this?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This yer was a grave. The hogs have rooted it up. I
tol’ the ol’ man he oughtn’t to turn the hogs in yer, but he
said he’d no other place to put ’em, and he had to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I picked up a skull lying loose on the ground like a cobblestone.
It was that of a young man; the teeth were all splendid
and sound. How hideously they grinned at me! and the eye-sockets
were filled with dirt. He was a tall man too, if that
long thigh-bone was his.</p>

<p class='c000'>Torn rags strewed the ground. The old ploughman picked
up a fragment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This yer was a Union soldier. You may know by the
blue cloth. But then that ain’t always a sign, for the Rebels
got into our uniform when they had a chance, and got killed
in it too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I turned the skull in my hand, half regretting that I could
not carry it away with me. My first shuddering aversion to
the grim relic was soon past. I felt a strange curiosity to
know who had been its hapless owner, carrying it safely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>through twenty or more years of life to lose it here. Perhaps
he was even then looking over my shoulder and smiling at it;
no longer a perishable mortal, but a spirit imperishable, having
no more use for such clumsy physical mechanism. The fancy
came so suddenly, and was for an instant so vivid, that I looked
up, half expecting that my eyes would meet the mild benignant
eyes of the soldier. And these words came into my mind:
“It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Let him who has never thought seriously of life look at it
through the vacant eye-sockets of a human skull. Then let
him consider that he himself carries just such a thing around
with him, useful here a little while, then to be cast aside.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Every face, however full,</div>
      <div class='line'>Padded round with flesh and fat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is but modelled on a skull.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Take the lesson to heart, O Vanity! It is but a little time, at
the longest, that the immortal soul thou art will animate this
bone; but the hour comes quickly when to have been a good
soldier of the truth on any field, whether resounding with arms,
or silent with the calm strong struggle of love and patience,
and to have given thy life to the cause, will be sweeter to thee
than the fatness of the earth and length of days. No, heroic
soldier! you I do not pity, though your mortal part lies here
neglected and at the mercy of swine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cornfield, and another field from which it was separated
by a fence at the time of the battle, are now thrown together,
forming a lot of about fifty acres. The upper part was dotted
with little dry brown cocks of seed-clover. No hogs were
on it at the time; they had been turned out, to save the clover-seed,
I presume, for that was of some consequence.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found plenty more bones and skulls of Union soldiers
rooted up and exposed, as we ascended the ridge. Beside
some lay their head-boards. I noted the names of a few:
“Sergt. Mahaffey, Co. C, 9th Regt. P. R. C.,” for one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Rebs had all the fence down ’cept a strip by the pike,”
said the ploughman. “That was jist like a sifter. Some of the
rails have been cut up and carried away for the bullet-holes.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>He showed me marks still remaining on the fence. Some
of our soldiers had cut their names upon it; and on one post
some pious Roman Catholic had carved the sacred initials:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“I. H. S.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon that was a soldier’s name too,” said my honest
ploughman. And so indeed it was,—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jesus Hominum Salvator</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond the pike, between it and the woods, was a narrow
belt of newly ploughed ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see them green spots over yon’ covered with weeds?
Them are graves that I skipped.” In the edge of the woods
beyond lay two unexploded shells which relic-hunters had not
yet picked up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I was exploring the fields with my good-natured
ploughman, Lewy Smith brought his horse around by the
roads. He was waiting for me on the pike. “The last time
I drove by yer,” he said, “there was a nigger ploughing in
that field, and every time he came to a grave he would just
reach over his plough, jerk up the head-board, and stick it
down behind him again as he ploughed along; and all the time
he never stopped whistling his tune.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We drove on to the Dunker church, sometimes called “the
Schoolhouse,”—a square, plain, whitewashed, one-story brick
building, without steeple, situated in the edge of the woods.
No one, from its appearance, would take it to be a church;
and I find that soldiers who fought here still speak of it as
“the Schoolhouse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Dunkers are a sect of plain people,” said one of the old
Dutch settlers. “They don’t believe in any wanities. They
don’t believe in war and fighting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But their church had got pretty seriously into the fight on
that occasion. “It was well smashed to pieces; all made like
a riddle; you could just look in and out where you pleased,”
said Lewy Smith. It had been patched up with brick and
whitewash, however, and the plain people, who “did not
believe in wanities,” once more held their quiet meetings there.
I thought much of them as we rode on. A serious, unshaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>thrifty class of citizens, they know well how to get a living,
and they bear an excellent reputation for honest industry
throughout the country. Their chief fault seems to be that
they persist in killing one of man’s divinest faculties,—as if
the sweet and refining sense of beauty would have been given
us but for a beneficent purpose. At the same time they do
believe sincerely in solid worldly goods,—as if they too were
not, after all, quite as much one of the “wanities”! Think
of it, my solemn long-bearded friend; you buy land, lay out
your dollar in perishable dust, or you expend it in the cultivation
of those gifts and graces which, if heaven is what I take it
to be, you will find use for when you get there. Now which
do you suppose will prove the better investment? All of religion
does not consist in psalm-singing and sedate behavior.
But I do wrong to criticise so worthy and unoffending a sect
of Christians, who are no doubt nearer the kingdom than the
most we call such; and I merely set out to say this: while we
are in the world, all its interests, all its great struggles, concern
us. We cannot sit indifferent. Non-intervention is unknown
to the awakened soul. Help the good cause we must, and
resist the evil; if we cannot fight, we can pray; and to think
of keeping out of the conflict that is raging around us is the
vainest thing of all, as yonder well-riddled plain people’s
church amply testifies.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was beginning to rain, Lewy Smith carried me on to
Sharpsburg, and there left me. A more lonesome place even
than Boonsboro’; the battle alone renders it in the least interesting;
a tossed and broken sort of place, that looks as if the
solid ground-swell of the earth had moved on and jostled it
since the foundations were laid. As you go up and down
the hilly streets, the pavements, composed of fragments of
limestone slabs, thrust up such abrupt fangs and angles at
you, that it is necessary to tread with exceeding caution. As
Sharpsburg was in the thick of the fight, the battle-scars it
still carries add to its dilapidated appearance. On the side
of the town fronting the Federal line of battle, every house
bears its marks; and indeed I do not know that any altogether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>escaped. Many were well peppered with bullets, shot and
shell. The thousand inhabitants of the place had mostly fled
to the river, where they would have been in a sad plight if
McClellan had followed up the Rebels on their defeat, and
done his duty by them. Imagine a bent bow, with the string
drawn. The bow is the river, and the string is the Confederate
line after the battle. At the angle of the string is Sharpsburg;
and between the string and the bow were the fugitives.
Fortunately for them, as for the enemy, McClellan did <em>not</em> do
his duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner I started to walk to the bridge, known henceforth
and for all time as “Burnside’s Bridge,” just as the road
his corps cut for itself through the forests over the mountain,
on his way hither from the Sunday fight, is known to everybody
as “Burnside’s Road.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A shower coming up by the way, I sought shelter under
the porch of a stone house, situated on a rising bank near the
edge of the town. I had scarcely mounted the steps when a
woman appeared, and with cordial hospitality urged me to enter
the sitting-room. Although the porch was the pleasanter
place,—overlooking the hills and mountains on the east, and
affording a comfortable wooden bench, where I had thought
to sit and enjoy the rain,—I accepted her invitation, having
found by experience that every dweller on a battle-field has
something interesting to tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>She and her neighbors fled from their homes on Tuesday
before the battle, and did not return until Friday. She, like
nearly every person I talked with who had acted a similar
part, was sorry she did not remain in the cellar of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When we came back, all I could do was jist to set right
down and cry.” The house had been plundered, their provisions,
and the household comforts they had been slowly
getting together for years, had been swept away by the all-devouring
armies. “Them that stayed at home did not lose
anything; but if the soldiers found a house deserted, that they
robbed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired which plundered the most, our men or the Rebels.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“That I can’t say, stranger. The Rebels took; but the
Yankees took right smart. We left the house full, and when
we got home we hadn’t a thing to eat. Some wounded men
had been fetched in, and they had got all the bedding that was
left, and all our clothing had been torn up for bandages. It
was a right hard time, stranger!”—spoken earnestly and with
tears. “I haven’t got well over it yet. It killed my old
father; he overworked getting the fences up again, and it
wore on him so he died within a year. We are jist getting
things a little to rights again now, but the place a’n’t what it
was, and never will be again, in my day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She showed me, in an adjoining room, a looking-glass
hanging within an inch or two of a large patched space in the
wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That glass was hanging on that nail, jist as it hangs now,
when a shell come in yer and smashed a bedstead to pieces
for me on that side of the room, and the glass wasn’t so much
as moved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Suspecting that I might be keeping her from her work, I
urged her to return to it, and found she had indeed quitted some
important household task, because “it didn’t seem right to leave
a stranger sitting alone.” I arose at once, on making that discovery,
telling her I would rest under the porch until the rain
was over. She appeared for a moment quite distressed, fearing
lest the subtle law of politeness should somehow suffer from her
neglect. This woman’s sense of hospitality was very strong,
her whole manner carrying with it an earnest desire to make
me comfortable and keep me entertained while in her house.
Although troubled about her kitchen affairs, she seemed far
more anxious about her duty to me,—as if the accident of
my being stopped by the rain at her gate had placed her under
sacred obligations. At last she thought of a happy solution of
the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll get some pears and treat ye!” I begged her not to
take that trouble for me; but she insisted, repeating with
pleased eagerness, “Yes, I’ll get some pears and treat ye!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She brought a dish of fruit, and afterwards sent two little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>girls, her nieces, to keep me company while I ate. They were
pretty, intelligent, well-dressed misses of ten and twelve; the
eldest of whom opened the conversation by saying,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right smart o’ fruit cher.” A phrase which I suspect
every stranger might not have understood, notwithstanding
her prettily persuasive smile. South of the Maryland and
Pennsylvania line, and indeed in the southern counties of
Pennsylvania, one ceases to hear of a <em>plenty</em> or a <em>good
deal</em>; it is always a “<em>heap</em>,” or “<em>right smart</em>.” The word
<em>here</em>, along the borders, is pronounced in various ways:
<em>here</em>, rarely; <em>yer</em>, commonly; <em>hyer</em>, which is simply <em>yer</em> with
an aspirate before it; <em>jer</em>, when the preceding word ends
with the sound of <em>d</em>, and <em>cher</em> after a final <em>t</em>. “Rough road
jer,” is the southern for “Rough road here”; “out cher,”
means, similarly, “out here”; the final <em>d</em> and <em>t</em> blending with
the <em>y</em> of <em>yer</em>, and forming <em>j</em> and <em>ch</em>, just as we hear “would
jew” for “would you,” and “can’t chew” for “can’t you,”
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little girls played their hospitable part very charmingly,
and I was sorry to leave them; but the rain ceasing,
I felt obliged to walk on. They took me to their aunt, whom
I wished to thank for her kindness. Finding that I had not
filled my pockets with the pears, as she had invited me to do,
she brought some grapes and gave me. I bore the purple
bunches in my hand, and ate them as I walked away from
the house. They were sweet as the remembered grace of
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridge was a mile farther on. The road strikes the
creek, and runs several rods along the right bank before crossing
it. If the tourist is surprised at the strength of the positions
on South Mountain, from which the Rebels were dislodged,
he will be no less amazed at the contemplation of Burnside’s
achievement here. Above the road as it approaches the bridge,
and above the creek below the bridge, rises a high steep bank,
like a bluff. To approach from the opposite side, exposed to
a concentrated infantry and artillery fire flashing all along this
crest,—to carry the bridge, and drive back the enemy from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>their vantage-ground,—one would say was a feat for the
heroes of the age of fable. But the truth is, though men are
slow to receive it, there never was any age, called “of fable,”
or another, better than this,—none that ever produced a more
heroic race of men. We have worshipped the past long enough;
it is time now to look a little into the merits of the present.
Troy, and Greece, and Rome were admirable in their day, and
the men of Israel did some doughty deeds; but the men of
New England, of the great Middle States, and of the vast
North-West, what have they done? The Homeric heroes
and demigods are in no way superior, except in brag, to the
hilarious lads of Illinois, or the more serious boys of Massachusetts.
Of materials such as these the poet would have
made a more resounding Iliad.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Burnside’s command could ever have crossed this
bridge, from the high banks on the other side to the steep
banks on this, in the face of superior numbers pouring their
deadly volleys upon them, that is what astonishes you; and
what grieves you is this: that reinforcements were not sent
to enable him to hold what he gained. If Porter, who had
the reserves, had been a man of right courage and patriotism,
or anything but a pet of the commanding general, he would
have gone into the fight when needed,—for reserves were not
invented merely to be kept nice and choice,—and the results
of that day would have been very different.</p>

<p class='c000'>I spent some hours about the bridge, the Antietam Creek
singing all the while its liquid accompaniment to my thoughts.
It sang the same song that day, but its peaceful music was
drowned by the roar and clash of the conflict. I sat down on
a rock and watched a flock of buzzards perched on the limbs of
a dead tree, looking melancholy,—resembling, to my mind,
greedy camp-followers and army speculators, who remembered
with pensive regret the spoils of the good old war-days.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridge is narrow, affording space for only one vehicle
at a time. It is built of stone, and rests on two solid butments
and two rounded piers. There are woods on both sides of the
stream. On the left bank they stand a little back from it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>on the right, they cover the side of the bluff below the bridge.
The trees all along here were well scarred with shot. Half
a mile below the bridge the creek makes a bold turn to the
right, and doubles back upon itself, forming a loop, then
sweeps away to the south, between a wooded hill on the west
and a magnificent growth of willows massing their delicate
green and drooping foliage along the low opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to the village, I visited the spot chosen as a
national cemetery for the slain. The ground had been purchased,
but work upon it had not yet commenced. As Pennsylvania
gave the soil for the Gettysburg Cemetery, so Maryland
gives the soil for this; while each State will defray its
portion of future expenses. In the Antietam cemetery it is
understood that the Rebel dead are to be included. Many
object to this; but I do not. Skeletons, rooted up by hogs,
and blanching in the open fields, are a sight not becoming a
country that calls itself Christian. Be they the bones of Patriots
or Rebels, let them be carefully gathered up and decently
interred without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Antietam National Burying-Ground also adjoins an old
town cemetery. It is situated on the right hand, at the summit
of the road, as you go up out of Sharpsburg towards
Boonsboro’. Here let them rest together, they of the good
cause, and they of the evil; I shall be content. For neither
was the one cause altogether good, nor was the other altogether
bad: the holier being clouded by much ignorance and
selfishness, and the darker one brightened here and there
with glorious flashes of self-devotion. It was not, rightly
speaking, these brothers that were at war. The conflict was
waged between two great principles,—one looking towards
liberty and human advancement, the other madly drawing the
world back to barbarism and the dark ages. America was
the chessboard on which the stupendous game was played, and
those we name Patriots and Rebels were but as the pawns.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great was the day of Antietam. Three thousand of the
enemy were buried on the field. We had two thousand
killed, upwards of nine thousand four hundred wounded, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>more than a thousand missing. Between the sweet dawn
and the bloody dusk of that dread day there fell <span class='fss'>TWENTY-FIVE
THOUSAND MEN</span>! Can the imagination conceive of such
slaughter?</p>

<p class='c000'>And, after all, the striking fact about Antietam is this,—that
it was a great opportunity lost. The premature surrender
of Harper’s Ferry, which set free the force besieging it,
and enabled the enemy to outnumber us on the field,—for
Stonewall Jackson was as anxious to get into the fight as Fitz
John Porter was to keep out of it,—and the subsequent inertia
of the General commanding the United States forces; these
two causes combined to save the Confederate army from annihilation.
No such opportunity for crushing the Rebellion
at a blow had been offered, nor was any such again offered,—not
even at Gettysburg, for the enemy there had no coiling
river in their rear to entangle them, and we had no fresh
troops to launch upon them,—nor at any period afterwards,
until Grant consummated that long-desired object; God’s good
time having not yet come.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Sharpsburg is not a promising place to spend the night
in, and I determined to leave it that evening. In search of a
private conveyance, I entered a confectioner’s shop, and asked
a young lady behind the counter if she knew any person who
would take me to Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; Mr. Bennerhalls,” she replied; “I reckon ye can
get him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She gave me particular directions for finding his house, and
I went up one of the broken pavements “fanged with murderous
stones,” in search of him. To my surprise I was told that
Mr. Bennerhalls did not live on that street; further, that no
person of that name was known in Sharpsburg. I returned to
the confectioner’s shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You said <em>Mr. Bennerhalls</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir; Mr. Bennerhalls, and Mr. Cramerhalls, and
Mr. Joneshalls; I should think you might get one of them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I fancy the young lady must have seen a smile on my
countenance just then. Bennerhalls, Cramerhalls, Joneshalls,—what
outlandish cognomens were these? Did half the
family names in Sharpsburg rejoice in the termination <em>halls</em>?</p>

<p class='c000'>“I <em>know</em> Mr. Joneshalls,” said the young lady, as I stood
solving the doubt, probably with an amused expression which
she mistook for sarcastic incredulity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Joneshalls” I had never heard of. But I had heard of
Jones. Thanks to that somewhat familiar name, I had found
a clue to the mystery. “Jones <em>hauls</em>,” thought I, that is to
say, Jones hauls people over the road in his wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the first-mentioned individual was not <em>Bennerhalls</em> at
all, but one Benner who <em>hauled</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I thanked the young lady for her courtesy,—and I am sure
she must have thought me a very pleasant man,—and went
to find Mr. Benner without the <em>halls</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>No difficulty this time. He was sitting on a doorstep, where
he had perhaps heard me before inquiring up and down for Mr.
Bennerhalls, and scratched his head over the odd patronymic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I have hosses, and I haul sometimes, but I can’t put
one on ’em over that road to Harper’s Ferry, stranger, nohow!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I got no more satisfaction out of Cramer, and still less out
of Jones, who informed me that not only he would not go, but
he didn’t believe there was a man in Sharpsburg that would.</p>

<p class='c000'>I returned to the tavern, and appealed to the landlord, a
pleasant and very obliging man, although not so well versed as
some in the art of keeping a hotel. To my surprise, after
what Jones had told me, he said, “if I could find no one else
to haul me, he would.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At five <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. M.</span></span> we left Sharpsburg in an open buggy under
a sky that threatened rain. Black clouds and thunder-gusts
were all around us. The mountains were wonderful to behold
the nearer slopes lying in shadow, sombre almost to blackness,
while beyond, rendered all the more glorious by that contrast,
rose the loveliest sun-smitten summits, basking in the peace of
paradise. Beyond these still were black-capped peaks, about
which played uncertain waves of light, belts and bars of softest
indescribable colors, perpetually shifting, brightening, and vanishing
in mist. It was like a momentary glimpse of heaven
through the stormy portals of the world. Then down came
the deluging rack and enveloped all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through occasional spatters of rain, angrily spitting squalls,
we whipped on. It was a fleet horse my friend drove. He
was pleased to hear me praise him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a North-Carolina horse. I brought him home with
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have been in the army then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>And out came the interesting fact that I was riding with
Captain Speaker of the First Maryland Cavalry, a man who
had seen service, and had things to tell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Everybody remembers, in connection with the shameful
surrender of Harper’s Ferry just before the battle of Antietam,
the brilliant episode of twenty-two hundred Federal cavalry
cutting their way out, and capturing a part of one of Longstreet’s
trains on their escape. Captain Speaker was the
leader of that expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was second lieutenant of the First Maryland Cavalry at
the time. I knew Colonel Davis very well; and when I heard
Harper’s Ferry was to be surrendered, I remarked to him that
I would not be surrendered with it alive. He asked what I
would do. ‘Cut my way out,’ said I. When he asked what
I meant, I told him I believed I could not only get out myself,
but that I could pilot out with safety any number of cavalry
that would take the same risk and go with me. I had lived in
the country all my life, and knew every part of it. Colonel
Davis saw that I was in earnest, and knew what I was talking
about. The idea just suited him, and he applied to Colonel
Miles for permission to put it into execution. Colonel Miles
was not a man to think much of such projects, and he was
inclined to laugh at it. ‘Who is this Lieutenant Speaker,’
said he, ‘who is so courageous?’ Colonel Davis said he
knew me, and had confidence in my plan. ‘It’s all talk,’ said
Miles; ‘put him to the test, and he’ll back down.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just try him,” said Davis.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So Miles wrote on a piece of paper,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lieutenant Speaker, will you take charge of a cavalry
force and lead it through the enemy’s lines?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I just wrote under it, on the same piece of paper, ‘Yes,
with pleasure;’ signed my name, and sent it back to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At ten o’clock the same night they started. It was Sunday,
the 14th of September, the day of the battle of South
Mountain. The party consisted of twenty-two hundred cavalry
and a number of mounted civilians who took advantage of
the expedition to escape from the town before it was surrendered.
Lieutenant Speaker and Colonel Davis rode side
by side at the head of the column. They crossed on the pontoon
bridge, which formed the military connection between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Harper’s Ferry and Maryland Heights, and turned up the
road which runs between the canal and the Heights, riding at
full charge along the left bank of the Potomac. It was a wild
road; the night was dark; only the camp-fires on the mountain
were visible; and there was no sound but the swift clatter
of thousands of galloping hoofs, and the solitary rush of the
Potomac waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near a church, four miles from the Ferry, Speaker and
Davis, who were riding ahead of the party, were challenged
by the Rebel pickets.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who goes there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Friends to the guard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What command?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Second Virginia Cavalry,” said Colonel Davis,—which
was true, the Second Virginia <em>Union</em> Cavalry being of the
party, while the Second Virginia <em>Rebel</em> Cavalry was also in
the vicinity. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Louisiana Tigers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. We are out scouting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” said the pickets.</p>

<p class='c000'>The leaders rode back, formed their party at a short distance,
gave the word, and charged. They went through the Rebel
line like an express-train. A few shots were fired at them
by the astonished pickets, but they got through almost without
loss. Three horses were killed and three men dismounted,
but the latter escaped up the mountain side, and afterwards
made their way safely into the Union lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>They galloped on to Sharpsburg, keeping the same road all
the way by which Captain Speaker was now conveying me to
the Ferry. The enemy held Sharpsburg. Fortunately in
every street and by-road Speaker was at home; He called
up a well-known Union citizen, from whom he obtained important
information. “The Rebels are in strong force on
the Hagerstown Road. They have heavy batteries, too, posted
on the Williamsport Pike.” There was then but one thing to
do. “Down with the fences and take to the fields,” said the
pilot of the party.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>This they accordingly did;—tramp, tramp, in the darkness,
by cross-roads and through fields and woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We struck the pike between Hagerstown and Williamsport
about two o’clock. We came to a halt pretty quick,
though, for there was a Rebel wagon-train several miles in
length, passing along the pike. There were no fences; and
the woods were clear and beautiful for our purpose. Our line
was formed along by the pike, extending some three-quarters of
a mile. Then we charged. The first the guards and drivers
knew, there were sabres at their heads; and all they had to do
was to turn their wagons right about and go with us. We
captured over seventy wagons, all the rear of the train. They
had to travel a little faster in the other direction than they had
been going, so that some of the wagons broke down by the
way; but the rest we got safely off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was just daylight when they arrived at Greencastle and
turned the wagons over to the Federal quartermaster there.
“Then you should have seen each fellow tumble himself off
his horse! Remember, we had been fighting at the Ferry,
and this was the third night we had had no sleep. Each man
just took a turn of the bridle around his wrist, and dropped
down on the pavement in the street, anywhere, and in three
minutes was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Colonel Davis and I found a cellar-door, softer than stones,
to lie on, and there we dropped. I was asleep as soon as my
head struck the board. But it couldn’t have been five minutes
before I was woke up by somebody pulling the bridle from my
wrist.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’What do you want?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Want your horse; want you; want to give you some
breakfast.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“I got my eyes open; it was broad day then; and it was a
beautiful sight! Everybody in Greencastle was crowding to
see the cavalry fellows that had cut their way through the
Rebel lines. The Colonel and I were surrounded with ladies
bringing us breakfast. I tell you, it was beautiful!” And the
Captain’s eyes glistened at the remembrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were hungry enough! But I said, ‘Just give my horse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>here something to eat first; then I’ll eat.’ ‘Certainly.’
And they were going to take him away from me, to some
stable. ‘Never mind about that,’ said I. ‘Just bring your
oats and empty them down here anywhere; he’s used to
eating off the ground.’ The oats were not slow coming; and
Colonel Davis and I and our horses had breakfast together,
with the ladies looking on. I tell you, it was beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is eleven miles from Sharpsburg to Harper’s Ferry. After
striking the Potomac, we continued on down its left bank, with
the canal between us and the river on one side, and Maryland
Heights, rising even more and more rugged and abrupt, on the
other; until, as we approached the bridge at the Ferry, we
looked up through the stormy dusk at mountain crags rising
precipitous several hundred feet above our heads. Crossing
the new iron bridge, near the ruins of the old one destroyed by
the Rebels, Captain Speaker landed me near the end of it on
the Virginia side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is the hotel?” I asked, looking round with some
dismay at the dismal prospect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is it, the only hotel at Harper’s Ferry now,”—showing
me a new, unpainted, four-story wooden building,
which looked more like soldiers’ barracks than a hotel. There
was not a window-blind or shutter to be seen. The main
entrance from the street was through a bar-room where merry
men were clicking glasses, and sucking dark-colored stuff
through straws. And this was a “first-class hotel kept on the
European plan.” I mention it as one of the results of war,—as
an illustration of the mushroom style of building which
springs up in the track of desolation, to fill temporarily the
place of the old that has been swept away and of the better
growth to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>One thing, however, consoled me. The hotel stood on the
banks of the Potomac, and I thought if I could get a room
overlooking the river and commanding a view of the crags
opposite, all would be well; for often the mere sight of a
mountain and a stream proves a solace for saddest things.</p>

<p class='c000'>After supper a “room” was shown me, which turned out
to be a mere bin to stow guests in. There was no paper on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the walls, no carpet on the rough board floor, and not so much
as a nail to hang a hat on. The bed was furnished with sheets
which came down just below a man’s knees, and a mattress
which had the appearance of being stuffed with shingles.
Finding it impossible, by dint of shouting and pounding, (for
there was no bell,) or even by visiting the office, to bring a
servant to my assistance, I went on a marauding expedition
through the unoccupied rooms, and carried off a chair, a dressing-table,
and another bed entire. This I placed on my
mattress, hoping thereby to improve the feeling of it,—a fruitless
experiment, however: it was only adding a few more
shingles. Luckily I had a shawl with me. Never,—let me
caution thee, O fellow-traveller,—never set out on a long
journey without a good stout shawl. Such an appendage
answers many purposes: a garment on a raw and gusty day, a
blanket by night, a cushion for the seat, a pillow for the head,—to
these and many like comfortable uses it is speedily applied
by its grateful possessor. Mine helped to soften the asperities
of my bed that night, and the next day served as a window-curtain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet no devices availed to render the Shenandoah House
a place favorable to sleep. On the river-side, close by the door,
ran the track of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. How often
during the night the trains passed I cannot now compute; each
approaching and departing with clatter and clang, and shouts
of men and bell-ringing and sudden glares of light, and the
voice of the steam-whistle projecting its shrill shriek into the
ear of horrified night, and setting the giant mountains to
tossing and retossing the echo like a ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning I was up at dawn refreshing my eyesight
with the natural beauties of the place. It was hard to believe
that those beauties had been lying latent around me during
all the long, wearisome night. But so it is ever; we see so
little of God’s great plan! The dull life we live, close and
dark and narrow as it seems, is surrounded by invisible realities,
waiting only for the rays of a spiritual dawn to light them
up into grandeur and glory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>AROUND HARPER’S FERRY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At Harper’s Ferry the Potomac and Shenandoah unite their
waters and flow through an enormous gap in the Blue Ridge.
The angle of land thus formed is a sort of promontory; around
the base of which, just where the rivers meet, the curious little
old town is built. Higher up the promontory lie Bolivar
Heights. On the north, just across the Potomac from the
Ferry, rise Maryland Heights; while on the east, across the
Shenandoah, are Loudon Heights, an equally precipitous and
lofty crag. With sublime rocky fronts these two mountains
stand gazing at each other across the river which has evidently
forced its way through them here. Just where the
streams are united the once happily wedded mountains are
divorced. No doubt there was once a stupendous cataract
here, pouring its shining sheet towards the morning sun, from
a vast inland sea; for the tourist still finds, far up the steep
face of the mountains, dimples which in past ages ceaselessly
whirling water-eddies made. In some of these scooped places
sand and smooth-worn pebbles still remain. But the mountain-wall
has long since been sundered, and the inland sea
drained off; the river forcing a way not only for itself but for
the turnpike, railroad, and canal, fore-ordained in the beginning
to appear in the ripeness of time and follow the river’s
course.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the town, as you perceive, is situated in the midst of
scenery which should make it a favorite place of summer resort.
The cliffs are picturesquely tufted, and tasselled, and
draped with foliage, boughs of trees, and festoons of wild vines,
through which here and there upshoot the perpendicular columns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of some bold crag, softened into beauty by the many-colored
lichens that stud its sides. I count an evening walk
under Loudon Heights, with the broad, sprawling river
hoarsely babbling over its rocky bed on one side, and the still
precipices soaring to heaven on the other,—and the narrow
stony road cut round their base lying before me, untrodden at
that hour by any human foot save my own,—I count that
lonely walk amid the cool, dewy scents stealing out of the undergrowth,
and the colors of the evening sky gilding the cliffs,
as one of the pleasantest of my life. What is there, as you
look up at those soaring summits and the low clouds sailing
silently over them, that fills the heart so full?</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning after my arrival I climbed Maryland Heights
by the winding military road which owes its existence to the
war. I have seen nothing since the view from Mount Washington
to be compared with the panorama which unrolled itself
around me as I ascended. Pictures of two States were there,
indescribably tinted in the early morning light,—beautiful
Maryland, still more beautiful Virginia, with the green Potomac
valley marking the boundary between. On the Maryland
side were the little valleys of the Monocacy and the
Antietam. Opposite lay the valley of the Shenandoah, dotted
with trees, its green fields spotted with the darker green of
groves, a vast tract stretching away into a realm of hazy light,
belted with sun and mist, and bounded by faint outlines of
mountains so soft they seemed built of ether but a little more
condensed than the blue of the sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet it was war and not beauty which led man to these
heights. The timber which once covered them was cut away
when the forts were constructed, in order to afford free range
for the guns; and a thick undergrowth now takes its place.
There are strong works on the summit, the sight of which
kindles anew one’s indignation at the imbecility which surrendered
them, with Harper’s Ferry and a small army, at a
time when such an act was sufficient to prolong the war perhaps
for years.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a steep mile and more by the road from the Ferry to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the top of the cliffs: a mile which richly repays the travel.
Yet one need not go so far nor climb so high to see the beauties
of the place. Whichever way you turn, river, or rock, or
wild woods charm the eye. The Potomac comes down from
its verdant bowers gurgling among its innumerable rocky
islets. On one side is the canal, on the other the race which
feeds the government works, each tumbling its yeasty super-flux
over waste-weir walls into the river. With the noise of
those snowy cascades sweetly blends the note of the boatman’s
bugle approaching the locks. The eye ranges from the river
to the crags a thousand feet above, and all along the mountain
side, gracefully adorned with sparse timber, feathery
boughs and trees loaded down with vines, and is never weary
of the picture. At evening, you sit watching the sunset colors
fade, until the softened gray and dusky-brown tints of the
cliffs deepen into darkness, and the moon comes out and silvers
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But while the region presents such features of beauty and
grandeur, the town is the reverse of agreeable. It is said to
have been a pleasant and picturesque place formerly. The
streets were well graded, and the hill-sides above were graced
with terraces and trees. But war has changed all. Freshets
tear down the centre of the streets, and the dreary hill-sides present
only ragged growths of weeds. The town itself lies half
in ruins. The government works were duly destroyed by the
Rebels; of the extensive buildings which comprised the armory,
rolling-mills, foundry, and machine-shops, you see but little
more than the burnt-out, empty shells. Of the bridge across
the Shenandoah only the ruined piers are left; still less remains
of the old bridge over the Potomac. And all about the
town are rubbish, and filth, and stench.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost alone of the government buildings, John Brown’s
“Engine-house” has escaped destruction. It has come out
of the ordeal of war terribly bruised and battered, it is true,
its windows blackened and patched like the eyes of a pugilist;
but there it still stands, with its brown brick walls and little
wooden belfry, like a monument which no Rebel hands were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>permitted to demolish. It is now used as a storehouse for
arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first time I visited this scene of the first blood shed in
the great civil war, which, although so few dreamed of it,
was even then beginning,—for John Brown’s flaming deed
was as a torch flung into the ready-heaped combustibles of the
rebellion,—while I stood viewing the spot with an interest
which must have betrayed itself, a genial old gentleman, coming
out of the government repair-shop close by, accosted me.
We soon fell into conversation, and he told me the story of
John Brown at Harper’s Ferry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So they took the old man and hung him; and all the time
the men that did it were plotting treason and murder by the
wholesale. They did it in a hurry, because if they delayed,
they wouldn’t have been able to hang him at all. A strong
current of public feeling was turning in his favor. Such a
sacrifice of himself set many to thinking on the subject who
never thought before; many who had to acknowledge in their
hearts that slavery was wrong and that old John Brown was
right. I speak what I know, for I was here at the time. I
have lived in Harper’s Ferry fifteen years. I was born and
bred in a slave State, but I never let my love of the institution
blind me to everything else. Slavery has been the curse
of this country, and she is now beginning to bless the day she
was delivered from it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are there many people here who think as you do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enough to carry the day at the polls. The most of them
are coming round to right views of negro suffrage, too. That
is the only justice for the blacks, and it is the only safety for
us. The idea of allowing the loyal colored population to be
represented by the whites, the most of whom were traitors,—of
letting a Rebel just out of the Confederate army vote, and
telling a colored man just out of the Union army that he has
no vote,—the idea is so perfectly absurd that the Rebels themselves
must acknowledge it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was hardly less interested in the conversation of an intelligent
colored waiter at the hotel. He had formerly been held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>as a slave in the vicinity of Staunton. At the close of the
war he came to the Ferry to find employment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There wasn’t much chance for me up there. Besides, I
came near losing my life before I got away. You see, the
masters, soon as they found out they couldn’t keep their slaves,
began to treat them about as bad as could be. Then, because
I made use of this remark, that I didn’t think we colored folks
ought to be blamed for what wasn’t our fault, for we didn’t
make the war, and neither did we declare ourselves free,—just
because I said that, not in a saucy way, but as I say it
to you now, one man put a pistol to my head, and was going
to shoot me. I got away from him, and left. A great many
came away at the same time, for it wasn’t possible for us to
stay there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now tell me candidly,” said I, “how the colored people
themselves behaved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, just tolerable. They were like a bird let out of a
cage. You know how a bird that has been long in a cage
will act when the door is opened; he makes a curious fluttering
for a little while. It was just so with the colored people.
They didn’t know at first what to do with themselves. But
they got sobered pretty soon, and they are behaving very
decent now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Harper’s Ferry affords a striking illustration of the folly of
secession. The government works here gave subsistence to
several hundred souls, and were the life of the place. The
attempt to overturn the government failed; but the government
works, together with their own prosperity, the mad fanatics
of Harper’s Ferry succeeded easily enough in destroying.
“The place never will be anything again,” said Mr. B., of
the repair-shop, “unless the government decides to rebuild
the armory,—and it is doubtful if that is ever done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet, with the grandeur of its scenery, the tremendous water-power
afforded by its two rushing rivers, and the natural advantage
it enjoys as the key to the fertile Shenandoah Valley,
Harper’s Ferry, redeemed from slavery, and opened to Northern
enterprise, should become a beautiful and busy town.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A TRIP TO CHARLESTOWN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One morning I took the train up the Valley to Charlestown,
distant from Harper’s Ferry eight miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroad was still in the hands of the government.
There were military guards on the platforms, and about an
equal mixture of Loyalists and Rebels within the cars. Furloughed
soldiers, returning to their regiments at Winchester or
Staunton, occupied seats with Confederate officers just out of
their uniforms. The strong, dark, defiant, self-satisfied face
typical of the second-rate “chivalry,” and the good-natured,
shrewd, inquisitive physiognomy of the Yankee speculator
going to look at Southern lands, were to be seen side by side,
in curious contrast. There also rode the well-dressed wealthy
planter, who had been to Washington to solicit pardon for his
treasonable acts, and the humble freedman returning to the
home from which he had been driven by violence, when the
war closed and left him free. Mothers and daughters of the
first families of Virginia sat serene and uncomplaining in
the atmosphere of mothers and daughters of the despised race,
late their slaves or their neighbors’, but now citizens like themselves,
free to go and come, and as clearly entitled to places in
the government train as the proudest dames of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed through a region of country stamped all over
by the devastating heel of war. For miles not a fence or
cultivated field was visible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is just like this all the way up the Shenandoah Valley,”
said a gentleman at my side, a Union man from Winchester.
“The wealthiest people with us are now the poorest. With
hundreds of acres they can’t raise a dollar. Their slaves have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>left them, and they have no money, even if they have the disposition,
to hire the freed people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I suggested that farms, under such circumstances, should be
for sale at low rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They should be; but your Southern aristocrat is a monomaniac
on the subject of owning land. He will part with his
acres about as willingly as he will part with his life. If the
Valley had not been the best part of Virginia, it would long
ago have been spoiled by the ruinous system of agriculture in
use here. Instead of tilling thoroughly a small farm, a man
fancies he is doing a wise thing by half tilling a large one.
Slave labor is always slovenly and unprofitable. But everything
is being revolutionized now. Northern men and northern
methods are coming into this Valley as sure as water runs down-hill.
It is the greatest corn, wheat, and grass country in the
world. The only objection to it is that in spots the limestone
crops out a good deal. There was scarcely anything raised
this season except grass; you could see hundreds of acres of
that waving breast-high without a fence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of a long hour’s ride we arrived at Charlestown,
chiefly interesting to me as the place of John Brown’s martyrdom.
We alighted from the train on the edge of boundless
unfenced fields, into whose melancholy solitudes the desolate
streets emptied themselves—rivers to that ocean of weeds.
The town resembled to my eye some unprotected female sitting
sorrowful on the wayside, in tattered and faded apparel, with
unkempt tresses fallen negligently about features which might
once have been attractive.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the steps of a boarding-house I found an acquaintance
whose countenance gleamed with pleasure “at sight,” as he
said, “of a single loyal face in that nest of secession.” He had
been two or three days in the place, waiting for luggage which
had been miscarried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are all Rebels here,—all Rebels!” he exclaimed, as
he took his cane and walked with me. “They are a pitiably
poverty-stricken set; there is no money in the place, and
scarcely anything to eat. We have for breakfast salt-fish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>fried potatoes, and treason. Fried potatoes, treason, and salt-fish
for dinner. At supper the fare is slightly varied, and we
have treason, salt-fish, fried potatoes, and a little more treason.
My landlady’s daughter is Southern fire incarnate; and she
illustrates Southern politeness by abusing Northern people and
the government from morning till night, for my especial edification.
Sometimes I venture to answer her, when she flies at
me, figuratively speaking, like a cat. The women are not the
only outspoken Rebels, although they are the worst. The
men don’t hesitate to declare their sentiments, in season and
out of season.” My friend concluded with this figure: “The
war-feeling here is like a burning bush with a wet blanket
wrapped around it. Looked at from the outside, the fire seems
quenched. But just peep under the blanket, and there it is,
all alive, and eating, eating in. The wet blanket is the present
government policy; and every act of conciliation shown the
Rebels is just letting in so much air to feed the fire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A short walk up into the centre of the town took us to the
scene of John Brown’s trial. It was a consolation to see that
the jail had been laid in ashes, and that the court-house,
where that mockery of justice was performed, was a ruin
abandoned to rats and toads. Four massy white brick pillars,
still standing, supported a riddled roof, through which God’s
blue sky and gracious sunshine smiled. The main portion of
the building had been literally torn to pieces. In the floorless
hall of justice rank weeds were growing. Names of Union
soldiers were scrawled along the walls. No torch had been
applied to the wood-work, but the work of destruction had been
performed by the hands of hilarious soldier-boys ripping up
floors and pulling down laths and joists to the tune of “John
Brown,”—the swelling melody of the song, and the accompaniment
of crashing partitions, reminding the citizens, who
thought to have destroyed the old hero, that his soul was
marching on.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was also a consolation to know that the court-house and
jail would probably never be rebuilt, the county-seat having
been removed from Charlestown to Shepherdstown—“forever,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>say the resolute loyal citizens of Jefferson County, who
refuse to vote it back again.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we were taking comfort, reflecting how unexpectedly
at last justice had been done in that court-house, the townspeople
passed on the sidewalk, “daughters and sons of beauty,”
for they were mostly a fine-looking, spirited class; one of whom,
at a question which I put to him, stopped quite willingly and
talked with us. I have seldom seen a handsomer young
face, a steadier eye, or more decided poise and aplomb;
neither have I ever seen the outward garment of courtesy so
plumply filled out with the spirit of arrogance. His brief
replies, spoken with a pleasant countenance, yet with short,
sharp, downward inflections, were like pistol-shots. Very
evidently the death of John Brown, and the war that came
swooping down in the old man’s path to avenge him, and to
accomplish the work wherein he failed, were not pleasing
subjects to this young southern blood. And no wonder. His
coat had an empty sleeve. The arm which should have been
there had been lost fighting against his country. His almost
savage answers did not move me; but all the while I looked
with compassion at his fine young face, and that pendent idle
sleeve. He had fought against his country; his country had
won; and he was of those who had lost, not arms and legs
only, but all they had been madly fighting for, and more,—prosperity,
prestige, power. His beautiful South was devastated,
and her soil drenched with the best blood of her young
men. Whether regarded as a crime or a virtue, the folly of
making war upon the mighty North was now demonstrated,
and the despised Yankees had proved conquerors of the chivalry
of the South. “Well may your thoughts be bitter,” my
heart said, as I thanked him for his information.</p>

<p class='c000'>To my surprise he appeared mollified, his answers losing
their explosive quality and sharp downward inflection. He
even seemed inclined to continue the conversation; and as
we passed on, we left him on the sidewalk looking after us
wistfully, as if the spirit working within him had still some
word to say different from any he had yet spoken. What his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>secret thoughts were, standing there with his dangling sleeve,
it would be interesting to know.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walking on through the town, we came to other barren
and open fields on the farther side. Here we engaged a bright
young colored girl to guide us to the spot where John Brown’s
gallows stood. She led us into the wilderness of weeds, waist-high
to her as she tramped on, parting them before her with
her hands. The country all around us lay utterly desolate,
without enclosures, and without cultivation. We seemed to
be striking out into the rolling prairies of the West, except
that these fields of ripening and fading weeds had not the summer
freshness of the prairie-grass. A few scattering groves
skirted them; and here and there a fenceless road drew its
winding, dusty line away over the arid hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is about where it was,” said the girl, after searching
some time among the tall weeds. “Nobody knows now just
where the gallows stood. There was a tree here, but that
has been cut down and carried away, stump and roots and
all, by folks that wanted something to remember John Brown
by. Every soldier took a piece of it, if ’twas only a little
chip.” So widely and deeply had the dying old hero impressed
his spirit upon his countrymen; affording the last great
illustration of the power of Truth to render even the gallows
venerable, and to glorify an ignominious death.</p>

<p class='c000'>I stood long on the spot the girl pointed out to us, amid the
gracefully drooping golden-rods, and looked at the same sky
old John Brown looked his last upon, and the same groves,
and the distant Blue Ridge, the sight of whose cerulean summits,
clad in Sabbath tranquillity and softest heavenly light,
must have conveyed a sweet assurance to his soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I turned and looked at the town, out of which flocked
the curious crowds to witness his death. Over the heads of the
spectators, over the heads of the soldiery surrounding him, his
eye ranged until arrested by one strangely prominent object.
There it still stands on the outskirts of the town, between it
and the fields,—a church, pointing its silent finger to heaven,
and recalling to the earnest heart those texts of Scripture from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>which John Brown drew his inspiration, and for the truth of
which he willingly gave his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had the curiosity to stop at this church on our way back
to the town. The hand of ruin had smitten it. Only the
brick walls and zinc-covered spire remained uninjured. The
belfry had been broken open, the windows demolished. The
doors were gone. Within, you saw a hollow thing, symbolical.
Two huge naked beams extended from end to end of the
empty walls, which were scribbled over with soldiers’ names,
and with patriotic mottoes interesting for proud Virginians to
read. The floors had been torn up and consumed in cooking
soldiers’ rations; and the foul and trampled interior showed
plainly what use it had served. The church, which overlooked
John Brown’s martyrdom, and under whose roof his executioners
assembled afterwards to worship, not the God of the
poor and the oppressed, but the God of the slaveholder and
the aristocrat, had been converted into a stable.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>A SCENE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Late in the evening of the twenty-ninth of August I
reached Washington.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly every reader, I suppose, is familiar with descriptions
of the national capital;—its superb situation on the left bank
of the Potomac; the broad streets, the still more spacious
avenues crossing them diagonally, and the sweeping undulations
of the plain on which it is built, giving to the city its
“magnificent distances”; and those grand public buildings
of which any country might be proud,—the Capitol especially,
with its cloudlike whiteness and beauty, which would be as
imposing as it is elegant, were it not that its windows are too
many and too small.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which the streets are built up, with here
and there a fine residence surrounded by buildings of an inferior
character, often with mere huts adjacent, and many an
open space, giving to the metropolis an accidental and heterogeneous
character,—the dust in summer, the mud in winter, the
fetor, the rubbish, the garbage; and the corresponding character
of the population, the most heterogeneous to be found in
any American city, comprising all classes strangely mixed
and fluctuating, the highest beside the lowest, the grandest
and broadest human traits jostled by the meanest and foulest,—one
half the people preying upon the other half, which preys
upon the government;—all this has been too often outlined
by others to be dwelt upon by me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I noticed one novel feature in the city, however. At the
hotel where I stopped, at the Attorney-General’s office which
I had occasion to visit, and again at the White House, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>I went to call on the President’s military secretary, I met,
repeatedly, throngs of the same or similar strange faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened to be one of the President’s reception days;
and the east room, the staircases, the lower and upper halls of
the White House, were crowded. The upper hall especially,
and the ladies’ parlor adjacent to the President’s room, were
densely thronged. Some were walking to and fro, singly or
in pairs; some were conversing in groups; others were lounging
on chairs, tables, window-seats, or whatever offered a support
to limbs weary of long waiting. One was paring his
nails; another was fanning himself with his hat; a third was
asleep, with his head resting much cramped in a corner of the
walls; a fourth was sitting in a window, spitting tobacco-juice
at an urn three yards off. When he took pains, he hit the
urn with remarkable precision, showing long and careful practice.
But he did not always take pains, for the extreme heat
and closeness of the apartments were not favorable to exertion;
and, indeed, what was the use of aiming always at the
urn, when nearly every man was chewing tobacco as industriously
as he, and generally spitting on the floors,—which
had already become the most convincing argument against the
habit of tobacco-chewing of which it is possible for the nauseated
imagination to conceive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Faces of old men and young men were there,—some weary
and anxious, a few persistently jocose, and nearly all betraying
the unmistakable Southern type. It was, on the whole, a well-dressed
crowd, for one so abominably filthy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nineteen out of twenty of all these people,” I was told by
the President’s secretary, “are pardon-seeking Rebels. The
most of them are twenty-thousand-dollar men, anxious to save
their estates from confiscation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As the President’s doors were expected soon to be opened,
and as I wished to observe his manner of dealing with those
men, I remained after finishing my business with the secretary,
and mingled with the crowd. The fumes of heated
bodies, in the ill-ventilated halls, were far from agreeable;
and as the time dragged heavily, and the doors of the President’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>room continued closed, except when some favored individual,
who had sent in his card, perhaps hours before, was
admitted, I was more than once on the point of abandoning
my object for a breath of fresh out-door air.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conversation of my Southern friends, however, proved
sufficiently interesting to detain me. One gay and jaunty old
man was particularly diverting in his remarks. He laughed
at the melancholy ones for their long faces, pretending that
he could tell by each man’s looks which clause of the exceptions,
in the President’s amnesty proclamation, his case came
under.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were a civil officer under the Confederate government.
Am I right? Of course I am. Your face shows it.
My other friend here comes under No. 3,—he was an officer
in the army. That sad old gentleman yonder, with a standing
collar, looks to me like one of those who left their homes
within the jurisdiction of the United States to aid the Rebellion.
He’s a number ten-er. And I reckon we are all thirteen-ers,”—that
is to say, persons of the thirteenth excepted class, the
value of whose taxable property exceeded twenty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, which clause do you come under?” asked one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am happy to say, I come under three different clauses.
Mine’s a particularly beautiful case. I’ve been here every
day for a week waiting on the President, and I expect to
have the pleasure of standing at this door many a day to come.
Take example by me, and never despair.” And the merry
old man frisked away, with his cap slightly on one side, covering
gray hairs. His gay spirits, in that not very hilarious
throng, attracted a good deal of attention: but his was not the
mirth of an inwardly happy mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are not a Southern man?” said one, singling me out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said I; “I am a Yankee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are not after a pardon, then. Lucky for you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have you done to be pardoned for?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am worth over twenty thousand dollars; that’s my difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“And you aided the Rebellion?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course,”—laughing. “Look here!”—his manner
changed, and his bright dark eye looked at me keenly,—“what
do you Northerners, you Massachusetts men particularly, expect
to do now with the niggers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We intend to make useful and industrious citizens of
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t!” “You never can do that!” “That’s an
absurdity!” exclaimed three or four voices; and immediately
I found myself surrounded by a group eager to discuss that
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The nigger, once he’s free, won’t work!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said another; “he’ll steal, but he won’t work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I pity the poor niggers, after what you’ve done for him,”
said a third. “They can’t take care of themselves; they’ll
starve before they’ll work, unless driven to it; and in a little
while they’ll be exterminated, just like the Indians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t think so,” said I. “The negro is very much like
the rest of us, in many respects. He won’t work unless he
is obliged to. Neither will you. So don’t blame him. But
when he finds work a necessity, that will drive him to it more
surely than any master.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You Northerners know nothing of the negro; you should
see him on our plantations!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I intend to do so. In the mean time you should see him
in our Northern cities, where he takes care of himself very
well, supports his family, and proves an average good citizen.
You should look into the affairs of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
here in Washington. There are in this city and its vicinity
upwards of thirty thousand colored people. The majority have
been suddenly swept into the department from their homes
by the chances of war. You would consequently expect to
find a vast number of paupers among them. But, on the
contrary, nearly all are industrious and self-supporting; only
about three hundred of the number receiving partial support
from the government. Now take my advice: give your
negroes a chance, and see what they will do.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“We do give them all the chance they can have. And
it’s for our interest to induce them to work. We are dependent
on labor; we are going to ruin as fast as possible for
want of it. In the course of eight or ten years, maybe, they
will begin to find out that everything in creation don’t belong
to them now they are free, and that they can’t live by
stealing. But by that time, where will we be? Where will
the negro be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these men, one was from Georgia, one from North Carolina,
and others from Florida and Virginia; yet they all concurred
in the opinion, which no argument could shake, that
the freedmen would die, but not work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our conversation was interrupted by the opening of the
President’s room. A strong tide instantly set towards it, resulting
in a violent jam at the door. I was carried in by the
crowd, but got out of it as soon as possible, and placed myself
in a corner where I could observe the proceedings of the reception.</p>

<p class='c000'>President Johnson was standing behind a barrier which extended
the whole length of the room, separating him from the
crowd. One by one they were admitted to him; each man
presenting his card as he passed the barrier. Those who were
without cards were refused admission, until they had provided
themselves with those little conveniences at a desk in
the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>I should scarcely have recognized the President from any
of his published pictures. He appeared to me a man rather
below the medium height, sufficiently stout, with a massy,
well-developed head, strong features, dark, iron-gray hair, a
thick, dark complexion, deep-sunk eyes, with a peculiarly
wrinkled, care-worn look about them, and a weary expression
generally. His voice was mild and subdued, and his manner
kindly. He shook hands with none. To each applicant for
pardon he put a question or two, sometimes only one, and
dispatched him, with a word of promise or advice. No one
was permitted to occupy more than a minute or two of his
time, while some were disposed of in as many seconds. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the whole, it was an interesting but sad scene; and I still
carry in my memory the President’s weary look, and the disappointed
faces of the applicants, who, after long waiting, and
perhaps going through with this same ceremony day after day,
received no intimation that the object of their hopes was near
its accomplishment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>BULL RUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Taking the train at Washington, and crossing the long railroad
bridge which spans the Potomac, I entered again a portion
of Virginia rendered celebrated and desolate by war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Running down to Alexandria, and making a short stop there,
we rattled on towards Manassas. All the names throughout
that region are historical, stamped and re-stamped upon
the memory of America by the burning brand of war. The
brakeman bawls in at the door of the car words which start
you with a thrill of recollection. The mind goes back through
four fiery years of conflict to the campaign of ’61, until
it grows bewildered, in doubt whether that contest or this
journey is unreal,—for surely one must be a dream! That
first season of disaster and dismay, which associated the names
of Fairfax Court House, Centreville, Bull Run, Manassas, with
something infinitely horrible and fatal, had passed away like a
cloud; the storm of the subsequent year, still more terrible,
except that we had grown accustomed to such, had also passed,
dissolving in thin vapor of history; and one would never have
guessed that such things had been, but for the marks of the
wrath of heaven, which had left the country scathed as with
hailstones and coals of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes, those skirmishes and dire contests were realities; and
now this quiet journey, this commonplace mode of travel into
what was then the “enemy’s country,” with hot-blooded Virginians
(now looking cool enough) sitting upon the seats next
us, and conversing tamely and even pleasantly with us when
we accosted them,—no murderous masked batteries in front,
no guerrillas in the woods waiting to attack the train; in short,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>no danger threatening but the vulgar one of railroad disasters,
of late become so common; this too was a reality no less
wonderful, contrasted with the late rampant days of Rebel
defiance.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Alexandria to Manassas Junction it is twenty-seven
miles. Through all that distance we saw no signs of human
industry, save here and there a sickly, half-cultivated cornfield,
which looked as if it had been put in late, and left to pine in
solitude. There were a few wood-lots still left standing; but
the country for the most part consisted of fenceless fields abandoned
to weeds, stump-lots, and undergrowths.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Manassas Junction!” announced the brakeman; and we
alighted. A more forbidding locality can scarcely be imagined.
I believe there were a number of houses and shops there before
the war, but they were destroyed, and two or three rum-shanties
had lately sprung up in their place. A row of black
bottles, ranged on a shelf under a rudely constructed shed, were
the first signs I saw of a reviving civilization. Near by a
new tavern was building, of so fragile and thin a shell, it seemed
as if the first high wind must blow it down. I also noticed
some negroes digging a well; for such are the needs of an
advancing civilization: first rum, then a little water to put into
it. All around was a desolate plain, slightly relieved from its
dreary monotony by two or three Rebel forts overgrown with
weeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tall young member of the Western press accompanied me.
I went to a stable to secure a conveyance to the battle-field;
and, returning, found him seated on the steps of one of the
“Refreshment Saloons,” engaged in lively conversation with
a red-faced and excitable young stranger. The latter was
speaking boastingly of “our army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which army do you mean? for there were two, you
know,” said my friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean the Confederate army, the best and bravest army
that ever was!” said he of the red face, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me,” remarked my friend, “the best and
bravest army that ever was got pretty badly whipped.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“The Confederate army never was whipped! We were
overpowered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see you Southern gentlemen have a new word. With
us, when a man goes into a fight and comes out second best,
the condition he is in is vulgarly called <em>whipped</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were overpowered by numbers!” ejaculated the
Rebel. “Your army was three times as big as ours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s nothing, for you know one Southerner was equal
to five Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so he is, and always will be! But you had to get
the niggers to help you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are a few niggers? They would always run, you
know, at sight of their masters, while of course such a thing
was never known as their masters running from them!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The unhappy member of the “overpowered” party flushed
and fumed a while, not knowing what answer to make, then
burst forth,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was the foreigners! You never would have beaten us if
it hadn’t been for the foreigners that made up your armies!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” said my friend, “you, an American, acknowledge
yourself beaten by foreigners! I am ashamed of you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And the wagon arriving, he jumped into it with a laugh,
leaving the Southerner, not whipped of course, but decidedly
“overpowered” in this little contest of wit. It was quite
evident that he was not equal to five Yankees with his tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That young fellow you was talking with,” said our driver,
“was one of Mosby’s guerrillas. There are plenty of them
around here. They are terrible at talking, but that is about
all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The wagon was an ambulance which had cost the government
two hundred and fifty dollars a few months before. The
springs proving inferior, it was condemned, and sold at auction
for twenty-four dollars. “I paid a hundred and twenty-five for
it the next day,” said the driver; “and it’s well worth the
money.” It was a strong, heavy, well-built vehicle, well suited
to his business. “I was down here with my regiment when I
got my discharge, and it struck me something might be made by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>taking visitors out to the battle-fields. But I haven’t saved a
cent at it yet; passengers are few, and it’s mighty hard business,
the roads are so awful bad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Worse roads are not often seen in a civilized country. “It
makes me mad to see people drive over and around these bad
places, month after month, and never think of mending ’em!
A little work with a shovel would save no end of lost time,
and wear and tear, and broken wagons; but it’s never done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The original country roads had passed into disuse; and, the
fences being destroyed, only the curious parallel lines of
straggling bushes and trees that grew beside them remained to
mark their course. Necessity and convenience had struck out
new roads winding at will over the fenceless farms. We
crossed thinly wooded barrens, skirted old orchards, and
passed now and then a standing chimney that marked the site
of some ruined homestead; up-hill and down-hill, rocking,
rattling, jolting, and more than once nearly upsetting. I remember
not more than three or four inhabited houses on our
route. In a wild field near the shelter of some woods was a
village of half-ruined huts, interesting as having served in wartime
as Rebel winter-quarters. At last, eight miles north from
the Junction, we reached the scene of the first battle of Bull
Run.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the plateau, from which our almost victorious
forces had driven and re-driven the enemy, when Johnston’s
reinforcements, arriving by the railroad which runs obliquely
towards the Junction on the west, changed what was so nearly
a triumph for our arms into a frightful disaster. The ground
is well described in Beauregard’s official report. “It is enclosed
on three sides by small watercourses which empty into
Bull Run within a few rods of each other, half a mile to the
south of Stone Bridge. Rising to an elevation of quite one
hundred feet above Bull Run at the bridge, it falls off on three
sides to the level of the enclosing streams in gentle slopes, but
which are furrowed by ravines of irregular direction and
length, and studded with clumps and patches of young pines
and oaks.”... “Completely surrounding the two houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>before mentioned are small open fields of irregular outline, and
exceeding one hundred and fifty acres in extent. The houses,
occupied at the time, the one by Widow Henry, the other by
the free negro Robinson, are small wooden buildings densely
embowered in trees and environed by a double row of fences
on two sides. Around the eastern and southern brow of the
plateau an almost unbroken fringe of second growth of pines
gave excellent shelter for our marksmen, who availed themselves
of it with the most satisfactory skill. To the west, adjoining
the fields, a broad belt of oaks extends directly across
the crest, on both sides of the Sudley road, in which, during
the battle, regiments of both armies met and contended for the
mastery. From the open ground of this plateau the view embraces
a wide expanse of woods and gently undulating open
country of broad grass and grain fields in all directions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the appearance of the battle-field on that memorable
twenty-first of July, four years before my visit. In its
external features I found it greatly changed. Many of the
trees had been cut away. Every fence had disappeared.
Where had waved the fields of grass and grain, extended one
vast, neglected, barren tract of country. The widow’s humble
abode had been swept away. The widow herself was killed
by a chance shot on the day of the battle. A little picket
fence surrounding her grave was the only enclosure visible to
us in all that region. Close by were the foundations of her
house, a small square space run up to tallest weeds. Some of
the poor woman’s hollyhocks still survived, together with a
few scattered and lonesome-looking peach-trees cut with balls.
The hollyhocks were in bloom, and the peaches were ripe: a
touching sight to me, who could see the haunting figure of the
poor widow looking at the favorite blossoms from her door, or
returning from the trees to the house with her apron full of the
fruit, which appeared duly year after year to comfort her, until
at last she was no longer there needing earthly comfort.
We were not past that material necessity, however; and the
poor woman’s peaches comforted us this year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a few yards of the spot where her house was, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>summit of the eminence, stands a pyramidal monument of
rough red sandstone, bearing this inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>IN</div>
    <div>MEMORY</div>
    <div>OF THE</div>
    <div>PATRIOTS</div>
    <div>WHO FELL AT</div>
    <div>BULL RUN</div>
    <div>JULY 21st, 1861.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This shaft, another inscription tells us, was erected June 10th,
1865. There it stands on the “sacred soil,” recalling to the
proud sons of Virginia many things. To them, and to all
Americans, it has a grand and deep significance beyond anything
words can convey. There it stands, a silent preacher,
with its breast of stone, and its austere face of stone, preaching
inaudible stern lessons. Bull Run may be called the Bunker
Hill of the last revolution. It was the prologue of disaster to
the far-off final triumph. Well fought at first, we had almost
won the day, when, fresh troops pressing us, came the crushing
defeat and horrible panic which filled the whole loyal North
with dismay and the whole rebel South with exultation.
Then how many a patriot heart fell sick with despair, and
doubtingly murmured, “Does God still live? and is there
after all an overruling Power?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Look at that monument to-day. Where now is the triumph
of the dark cause? Where now is the haughty slave empire
whose eternal foundations were deemed established by that
victory? Where is the banner of Freedom trailed so low, all
torn and blood-stained, in the dust? God lives! There is an
overruling Power that never sleeps; patient, foreseeing what
we cannot see, and, in sublime knowledge of the end, tolerating
the wrath of the unrighteous and the arrogance of the unjust.
The day of victory for freedom had not yet come; for triumph
then would have been but half triumph. Temporary success
to the bad cause was necessary to draw it irretrievably into
the currents of destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, struggle and long agony were needful to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>nation. Frivolous, worldly, imitating other nations; nourishing
in the very bosom of the Republic the serpent of a
barbarous despotism; in our heedlessness and hurry giving no
ear to the cries of the oppressed; we needed the baptism of
blood and the awful lessons of loss to bring us back to sanity
and soberness. The furnace of civil war was indispensable to
fuse conflicting elements, and to pour the molten materials of
the diverse States into the single mould of one mighty and
masterful Nation. In order that it might take the lead of all
the proud banners on the globe, our flag must first be humbled,
and win its way through dust and battle-smoke to the eminence
above all eminences of earthly power, where it is destined at
last to float.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to have been something fatal to our armies in
the mere name of Bull Run. The visitor to the scene of the
first disaster is already on the field of the second. The battles
of the subsequent year, fought on a more stupendous scale,
and sweeping over a vast area, included within their scope the
hills on which we were standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>To reach the scene of the principal contest in 1862, however,
an advance of a mile or two had to be made. We rode
on to a piece of woods, in the shade of which we halted, surrounded
by marks of shot and shell in the timber, and by
soldiers’ graves lying lonely among the trees, with many a
whitened bone scattered about or protruding. There, it being
mid-day, we partook of luncheon sauced with Widow Henry’s
peaches.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the west of us was a large stony field sloping up to a
wood-crowned height,—a field strown thick with dead in
those sanguinary days of ’62. The woods in which we were,
extended around the north side of it also, forming a connection
with the woods beyond. Making the circuit of this shady
boundary, we reached the crest, which, strengthened greatly by
an unfinished railroad track cut through it, afforded the enemy
their most formidable position during the second Bull Run
battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the summit of the open field stands another monument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>similar to that we had first seen, dedicated to the “Memory
of the Patriots who fell at Groverton, August 28th, 29th, and
30th, 1862.” This inscription had been mutilated by some
Rebel hand, and made to read “Confederate Patriots”; but
my tall friend, arming himself with a stone, stepped upon the
pedestal, amid the black rows of shells surrounding it, and
resolutely ground the offensive word out of the tablet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Groverton, which has given the field its name, is a little
cluster of three or four buildings lying out west of it on the
turnpike.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two or three points of striking resemblance between
the first and second battles of Bull Run. At one time
almost a victory, this also proved at last a defeat; and again
the North was filled with consternation at seeing the barrier
of its armies broken, and the country laid open to the foe.
After the first Bull Run, the Rebels might have entered
Washington almost without opposition. After the second, they
did invade Maryland, getting as far as Antietam. It is also a
circumstance worthy of note, that in each fight the victory
might have been rendered complete, but for the failure of an
important command to perform the part assigned it. General
Patterson remained inert at Winchester, while Johnston,
whom it was his business to look after, hastened to reinforce
Beauregard and turn the scale of battle. At the second Bull
Run, General Porter’s neglect to obey the orders of General
Pope wrought incalculable mischief, and contributed similarly
to change the opening successes into final discomfiture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly the lesson taught by both disasters is the same: that
the triumph of a bad cause is but illusory and transient; while
for the cause which moves duly in the divine currents of
human progress there can be no failure, for, though tossed and
buffeted, and seemingly wrecked, its keel is in the eternal
waters, the winds of heaven fill its sails, and the hand of the
Great Pilot is at the helm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning, we stopped at the “stone house” near the first
battle-field, in hopes of getting some personal information from
the inhabitants. They were present during the fight, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>outer walls show enduring marks of the destructive visits of
cannon-shot. The house was formerly a tavern, and the man
who kept it was one of those two-faced farmers, Secessionists
at heart, but always loyal to the winning side. By working
well his political weathercock, he had managed to get his
house through the storm, although in a somewhat dismantled
condition. The bar-room was as barren as the intellect of
the owner. The only thing memorable we obtained there
was some most extraordinary cider. This the proprietor was
too proud to sell, or else the pretence that it belonged to the
“old nigger” was nearer the truth than my tall friend was
willing to admit. At all events, the “old nigger” brought it
in, and received pay for it besides, evidently contrary to his
expectations, and to the disappointment of the landlord.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Uncle, what sort of cider is this? how did you make it?”
For neither of us had ever tasted anything resembling it before,
nor did we wish ever to taste its like again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Uncle, standing in the door, with one foot on the threshold,
ducking and grinning, one hand holding his old cap, and
the other his knee, after earnest urging, told us the secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat cidah, sah, I made out o’ peaches and apples mixed,
’bout half and half. Dat’s what makes it taste cur’us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, but that’s not all, uncle; you put water in it! You
meant to cheat us, I see, with your miscegenated cider and
water!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Uncle did not exactly understand the nature of this charge,
but evidently thought it something serious.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no, gentlemen, I didn’t do it for roguishness! I put
in de peaches ’case dar wasn’t apples enough. I pounded
’em up wid a pestle in a barrel. Den I put a stake under de
house corner wid rocks on to it for a press. I put de water
in to make de juice come easier, it was so dry!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having learned his method of manufacturing cider, we inquired
his opinion of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Didn’t you think, Uncle, the white folks were great fools
to kill each other the way they did?” said my friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Twouldn’t do for me to say so; dey was old enough, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>ageable enough, to know best; but I couldn’t help tink’n
sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to the Junction, I saw a very different type of
the Virginia negro: an old man of seventy, who conversed
intelligently, but in a strangely quiet and subdued tone, which
bespoke long suffering and great patience. He had been a
free man seven years, he told me; but he had a brother who
still served the man he belonged to.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he, too, is free now,” I said. “Don’t he receive
wages?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The old man shook his head sadly. “There’s nothing said
about wages to any of our people in this part of the country.
They don’t dare to ask for them, and their owners will hold
them as they used to as long as they can. They are very
sharp with us now. If a man of my color dared to say what
he thought, it would be all his life was worth!”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>A VISIT TO MOUNT VERNON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On a day of exceeding sultriness (it was the fourth of September)
I left the dusty, stifled streets of Washington, and
went on board the excursion steamer Wawaset, bound for
Mount Vernon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten o’clock, the hour of starting, had nearly arrived. No
breath of air was stirring. The sun beat down with torrid
fervor upon the boat’s awnings, which seemed scarce a protection
against it, and upon the glassy water, which reflected it
with equal intensity from below. Then suddenly the bell
rang, the boat swung out in the river, the strong paddles
rushed, and almost instantly a magical change took place. A
delightful breeze appeared to have sprung up, increasing as
the steamer’s speed increased. I sat upon a stool by the wheelhouse,
drinking in all the deliciousness of that cooling motion
through the air, and watching compassionately the schooners
with heavy and languid sails lying becalmed in the channel,—indolent
fellows, drifting with the tide, and dependent on influences
from without to push them,—while our steamer, with
flashing wake, flag gayly flying, and decks swept by wholesome,
animating winds, resembled one of your energetic, original
men, cutting the sluggish current, and overcoming the
sultriness and stagnation of life by a refreshing activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>On we sped, leaving far behind the Virginia long-boats, with
their pointed sails on great poles swung aslant across the
masts,—sails dingy in color and irregular in shape, looking,
a little way off, like huge sweet potatoes. Our course was
southward, leaving far on our right the Arlington estate embowered
in foliage on the Virginia shore; and on our left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the Navy Yard and Arsenal, and the Insane Asylum standing
like a stern castle, half hidden by trees, on the high banks back
from the river. As we departed from the wharves, a view of
the city opened behind us, with its two prominent objects,—the
unfinished Washington Monument, resembling in the distance
a tall, square, pallid sail; and the many-pillared, beautiful
Capitol, rising amid masses of foliage, with that marvellous
bubble, its white and airy dome, soaring superbly in the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before us, straight in our course, was Alexandria, quaint
old city, with its scanty fringe of straight and slender spars,
and its few anchored ships suspended in a glassy atmosphere,
as it seemed, where the river reflected the sky. We ran in to
the wharves, and took on board a number of passengers; then
steamed on again, down the wide Potomac, until, around a
bend, high on a wooded shore, a dim red roof and a portico
of slender white pillars appeared visible through the trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Mount Vernon, the home of Washington. The
shores here, on both the Maryland and Virginia sides, are
picturesquely hilly and green with groves. The river between
flows considerably more than a mile wide: a handsome sheet,
reflecting the woods and the shining summer clouds sailing
in the azure over them, although broad belts of river-grass,
growing between the channel and the banks like strips of
inundated prairie, detract from its beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we drew near, the helmsman tolled the boat’s bell slowly.
“Before the war,” said he, “no boat ever passed Mount
Vernon without tolling its bell, if it had one. The war kind
of broke into that custom, as it did into most everything else;
but it is coming up again now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We did not make directly for the landing, but kept due on
down the channel until we had left Mount Vernon half a mile
away on our right. Then suddenly the steamer changed her
course, steering into the tract of river-grass, which waved and
tossed heavily as the ripple from the bows shook it from its
drowsy languor. The tide rises here some four feet. It was
low tide then, and the circuit we had made was necessary to
avoid grounding on the bar. We were entering shallow water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>We touched and drew hard for a few minutes over the yielding
sand. The dense grass seemed almost as serious an impediment
as the bar itself. Down among its dark heaving
masses we had occasional glimpses of the bottom, and saw
hundreds of fishes darting away, and sometimes leaping sheer
from the surface, in terror of the great, gliding, paddling
monster, invading, in that strange fashion, their peaceful domain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Drawing a well-defined line half a mile long through that
submerged prairie, we reached the old wooden pier, built out
into it from the Mount Vernon shore. I did not land immediately,
but remained on deck, watching the long line of pilgrims
going up from the boat along the climbing path and
disappearing in the woods. There were, perhaps, a hundred
and fifty in the procession, men and women and children,
some carrying baskets, with intent to enjoy a nice little picnic
under the old Washington trees. It was a pleasing sight,
rendered interesting by the historical associations of the place,
but slightly dashed with the ludicrous, it must be owned, by
a solemn tipsy wight bringing up the rear, singing, or rather
bawling, the good old tune of Greenville, with maudlin nasal
twang, and beating time with profound gravity and a big
stick.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the singer, as well as his tune, was tediously slow, I
passed him on the way, ascended the long slope through the
grove, and found my procession halted under the trees on the
edge of it. Facing them, with an old decayed orchard behind
it, was a broad, low brick structure, with an arched entrance
and an iron-grated gate. Two marble shafts flanked
the approach to it on the right and left. Passing these, I
paused, and read on a marble slab over the Gothic gateway
the words,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Within this enclosure rest the remains of General
George Washington</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The throng of pilgrims, awed into silence, were beginning
to draw back a little from the tomb. I approached, and leaning
against the iron bars, looked through into the still, damp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>chamber. Within, a little to the right of the centre of the
vault, stands a massive and richly sculptured marble sarcophagus,
bearing the name of “Washington.” By its side, of
equal dimensions, but of simpler style, is another, bearing the
inscription, “Martha, the consort of Washington.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a sequestered spot, half enclosed by the trees of the
grove on the south side,—cedars, sycamores, and black-walnuts,
heavily hung with vines, sheltering the entrance from the
mid-day sun. Woodpeckers flitted and screamed from trunk
to trunk of the ancient orchard beyond. Eager chickens were
catching grasshoppers under the honey-locusts, along by the
old wooden fence. And, humming harmlessly in and out
over the heads of the pilgrims, I noticed a colony of wasps,
whose mud-built nests stuccoed profusely the yellowish ceiling
of the vault.</p>

<p class='c000'>There rest the ashes of the great chieftain, and of Martha
his wife. I did not like the word “consort.” It is too fine
a term for a tombstone. There is something lofty and romantic
about it; but “wife” is simple, tender, near to the
heart, steeped in the divine atmosphere of home,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A something not too bright and good</div>
      <div class='line'>For human nature’s daily food.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>She was the <em>wife</em> of Washington: a true, deep-hearted
woman, the blessing and comfort, not of the Commander-in-chief,
not of the first President, but of the <span class='fss'>MAN</span>. And Washington,
the <span class='fss'>MAN</span>, was not the cold, majestic, sculptured figure
which has been placed on the pedestal of history. There was
nothing marble about him but the artistic and spotless finish
of his public career. Majestic he truly was, as simple greatness
must be; and cold he seemed to many;—nor was it fitting
that the sacred chambers of that august personality should be
thrown open to the vulgar feet and gaze of the multitude. It
is littleness and vanity that are loose of tongue and unseasonably
familiar.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yet shine forever virgin minds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beloved by stars and purest winds,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Which, o’er passion throned sedate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have not hazarded their state;</div>
      <div class='line'>Disconcert the searching spy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rendering, to the curious eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>The durance of a granite ledge</div>
      <div class='line'>To those who gaze from the sea’s edge.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of these virgin minds was Washington. The world saw
him through a veil of reserve, as habitual to him as the sceptre
of self-control. Yet beneath that veil throbbed a fiery nature,
which on a few rare occasions is known to have flamed forth
into terrible wrath. Anecdotes, recording those instances of
volcanic eruption from the core of this serene and lofty character,
are refreshing and precious to us, as showing that the
ice and snow were only on the summit, while beneath burned
those fountains of glowing life which are reservoirs of power
to the virtue and will that know how to control them. A
man of pure, strong, constant affections, his love of tranquil
domestic enjoyments was as remarkable as his self-sacrificing
patriotism. I know not Washington’s “consort”; but to me
a very sweet, beautiful, and touching name is that of “Martha,
Washington’s wife.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Quitting the tomb, I walked along by the old board fence
which bounds the corner of the orchard, and turned up the
locust-shaded avenue leading to the mansion. On one side
was a wooden shed, on the other an old-fashioned brick barn.
Passing these, you seem to be entering a little village. The
out-houses are numerous; I noticed the wash-house, the meat-house,
and the kitchen, the butler’s house, and the gardener’s
house,—neat white buildings, ranged around the end of the
lawn, among which the mansion stands the principal figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking in at the wash-house, I saw a pretty-looking colored
girl industriously scrubbing over a tub. She told me
that she was twenty years old, that her husband worked
on the place, and that a bright little fellow, four years old,
running around the door, handsome as polished bronze, was
her son. She formerly belonged to John A. Washington,
who made haste to carry her off to Richmond, with the money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the Ladies’ Mount Vernon Association had paid him, on the
breaking out of the war. She was born on the place, but
had never worked for John A. Washington. “He kept me
hired out; for I s’pose he could make more by me that way.”
She laughed pleasantly as she spoke, and rubbed away at the
wet clothes in the tub.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked at her, so intelligent and cheerful, a woman and a
mother, though so young; and wondered at the man who
could pretend to own such a creature, hire her out to other
masters, and live upon her wages! I have heard people scoff
at John A. Washington for selling the inherited bones of
the great,—for surely the two hundred thousand dollars,
paid by the Ladies’ Association for the Mount Vernon estate,
was not the price merely of that old mansion, these out-houses,
since repaired, and two hundred acres of land,—but I do not
scoff at him for that. Why should not one, who dealt in living
human flesh and blood, also traffic a little in the ashes of the
dead?</p>

<p class='c000'>“After the war was over, the Ladies’ Association sent for
me from Richmond, and I work for them now,” said the girl,
merrily scrubbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What wages do you get?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I gits seven dollars a month, and that’s a heap better ’n
no wages at all!” laughing again with pleasure. “The
sweat I drap into this yer tub is my own; but befo’e, it belonged
to John A. Washington.” As I did not understand
her at first, she added, “You know, the Bible says every one
must live by the sweat of his own eyebrow. But John A.
Washington, he lived by the sweat of my eyebrow. I alluz
had a will’n mind to work, and I have now; but I don’t work
as I used to; for then it was work to-day and work to-morrow,
and no stop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside the kitchen was a well-house, where I stopped
and drank a delicious draught out of an “old oaken bucket,”
or rather a new one, which came up brimming from its cold
depths. This well was dug in General Washington’s time, the
cook told me; and as I drank, and looked down, down into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>dark shaft at the faintly glimmering water,—for the well was
deep,—I thought how often the old General had probably
come up thither from the field, taken off his hat in the shade,
and solaced his thirst with a drink from the dripping bucket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing between the kitchen and the butler’s house, you
come upon a small plateau, a level green lawn, nearly surrounded
by a circle of large shade-trees. The shape of this
pleasant esplanade is oblong: at the farther end, away on the
left, is the ancient entrance to the grounds; close by on the
right, at the end nearest the river, is the mansion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the shade-trees, of which there are a great variety,
I noticed a fine sugar-maple, said to be the only individual
of the species in all that region. It was planted by General
Washington, “who wished to see what trees would grow in
that climate,” the gardener told me. It has for neighbors,
among many others, a tulip-tree, a Kentucky coffee-tree, and
a magnolia set out by Washington’s own hand. I looked at
the last with peculiar interest, thinking it a type of our country,
the perennial roots of which were about the same time laid
carefully in the bosom of the eternal mother, covered and
nursed and watered by the same illustrious hand,—a little tree
then, feeble, and by no means sure to live; but now I looked
up, thrilling with pride at the glory of its spreading branches,
its storm-defying tops, and its mighty trunk which not even
the axe of treason could sever.</p>

<p class='c000'>I approached the mansion. It was needless to lift the great
brass knocker, for the door was open. The house was full of
guests thronging the rooms and examining the relics; among
which were conspicuous these: hanging in a little brass-framed
glass case in the hall, the key of the Bastile, presented to
Washington by Lafayette; in the dining-hall, a very old-fashioned
harpsichord that had entirely lost its voice, but
which is still cherished as a wedding-gift from Washington to
his adopted daughter; in the same room, holsters and a part
of the Commander-in-chief’s camp-equipage, very dilapidated;
and, in a square bedroom up-stairs, the bedstead on which
Washington slept, and on which he died. There is no sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>more touching than this bedstead, surrounded by its holy
associations, to be seen at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the house I went out on the side opposite that on
which I had entered, and found myself standing under the
portico we had seen when coming down the river. A noble
portico, lofty as the eaves of the house, and extending the
whole length of the mansion,—fifteen feet in width and ninety-six
in length, says the Guide-Book. The square pillars supporting
it are not so slender, either; but it was their height
which made them appear so when we first saw them miles off
up the Potomac.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a portico for a statesman to walk under,—so lofty, so
spacious, and affording such views of the river and its shores,
and the sky over all! Once more I saw the venerable figure
of him, the first in war and the first in peace, pacing to and
fro on those pavements of flat stone, solitary, rapt in thought,
glancing ever and anon up the Potomac towards the site of the
now great capital bearing his name, contemplating the revolution
accomplished, and dreaming of his country’s future.
There was one great danger he feared: the separation of the
States. But well for him, O, well for the great-hearted and
wise chieftain, that the appalling blackness of the storm, destined
so soon to deluge the land with blood for rain-drops, was
hidden from his eyes, or appeared far in the dim horizon no
bigger than a man’s hand!</p>

<p class='c000'>Saved from the sordid hands of a degenerate posterity, saved
from the desolation of unsparing civil war, Mount Vernon
still remains to us with its antique mansion and its delightful
shades. I took all the more pleasure in the place, remembering
how dear it was to its illustrious owner. There is no
trait in Washington’s character with which I sympathize so
strongly as with his love for his home. True, that home
was surrounded with all the comforts and elegancies which
fortune and taste could command. But had Mount Vernon
been as humble as it was beautiful, Washington would have
loved it scarcely less. It was dear to him, not as a fine estate,
but as the home of his heart. A simply great and truly wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>man, free from foolish vanity and ambition, he served his
country with a willing spirit; yet he knew well that happiness
does not subsist upon worldly honors nor dwell in high places,
but that her favorite haunt is by the pure waters of domestic
tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There came up a sudden thunder-shower while we were at
the house. The dreadful peals rolled and rattled from wing to
wing of the black cloud that overshadowed the river, and the
rain fell in torrents. Umbrellas were scarce, and I am sorry
to say the portico leaked badly. But the storm passed as suddenly
as it came; the rifted clouds floated away with sunlit
edges glittering like silver fire, and all the wet leafage of the
trees twinkled and laughed in the fresh golden light. I did
not return to the boat with the crowd by the way we came,
but descended the steep banks through the drenched woods
in front of the mansion, to the low sandy shore of the Potomac,
then walked along the water’s edge, under the dripping
boughs, to the steamer, and so took my leave of Mount
Vernon.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>“STATE PRIDE.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Leaving Washington by steamer again, early on the morning
of the twelfth of September, a breezy sail of three hours
down the Potomac brought us to Acquia Creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creek was still there, debouching broad and placid into
the river, for, luckily, destroying armies cannot consume the
everlasting streams. The forests, which densely covered all
that region before the war, had been cut away. Not a building
of any kind was to be seen; and only the blackened ruins
of half-burnt wharves, extending out into the river, remained
to indicate that here had been an important depot of supplies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking the cars near an extemporized landing, we traversed
a country of shaggy hills, completely clad in thick undergrowths
which had sprung up where the ancient forests stood.
At the end of two hours’ slow travel, through a tract almost
exclusively of this character, we arrived at a hiatus in the
railroad. The bridge over the Rappahannock not having
been rebuilt since the war, it was necessary to cross to Fredericksburg
by another conveyance than the cars. A long line
of coaches was in waiting for the train. I climbed the topmost
seat of the foremost coach, which was soon leading the
rumbling, dusty procession over the hills toward the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>From a barren summit we obtained a view of Fredericksburg,
pleasantly situated on the farther bank of the river, with
the high ridge behind it which Burnside endeavored in vain
to take. We crossed the brick-colored Rappahannock (not
a lovely stream to look upon) by a pontoon bridge, and ascending
the opposite shore, rode through the half-ruined city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fredericksburg had not yet begun to recover from the effects
of Burnside’s shells. Scarcely a house in the burnt portions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>had been rebuilt. Many houses were entirely destroyed, and
only the solitary chimney-stacks remained. Of others, you
saw no vestige but broken brick walls, and foundations overgrown
with Jamestown-weeds, sumachs, and thistles. Farther
up from the river the town had been less badly used; but we
passed even there many a dwelling with a broken chimney,
and with great awkward holes in walls and roofs. Some were
windowless and deserted; but others had been patched up and
rendered inhabitable again. High over the city soar the
church-spires, which, standing between two artillery fires on
the day of the battle, received the ironical compliments of
both. The zinc sheathing of one of these steeples is well
riddled and ripped, and the tipsy vane leans at an angle of
forty-five degrees from its original perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting next me on the stage-top was a vivacious young expressman,
who was in the battle, and who volunteered to give
me some account of it. No doubt his description was beautifully
clear, but as he spoke only of “our army,” without calling
it by name, it was long before I could decide which army was
meant. Sometimes it seemed to be one, then it was more
likely the other; so that, before his account of its movements
was ended, my mind was in a delightful state of confusion. A
certain delicacy on my part, which was quite superfluous, had
prevented me from asking him plainly at first on which side
he was fighting. At last, by inference and indirection, I got
at the fact;—“our army” was the Rebel army.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am a son of Virginia!” he told me afterwards, his whole
manner expressing a proud satisfaction. “I was opposed to
secession at first, but afterwards I went into it with my whole
heart and soul. Do you want to know what carried me in?
State pride, sir! nothing else in the world. I’d give more for
Virginia than for all the rest of the Union put together; and
I was bound to go with my State.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was spoken with emphasis, and a certain rapture, as a
lover might speak of his mistress. I think I never before realized
so fully what “State pride” was. In New England and
the West, you find very little of it. However deep it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>lie in the hearts of the people, it is not their habit to rant
about it. You never hear a Vermonter or an Indianian exclaim,
“I believe my State is worth all the rest of the Union!”
with excited countenance, lip curved, and eye in fine frenzy
rolling. Their patriotism is too large and inclusive to be
stopped by narrow State boundaries. Besides, in communities
where equality prevails there is little of that peculiar pride
which the existence of caste engenders. Accustomed to look
down upon slaves and poor whites, the aristocratic classes soon
learn to believe that they are the people, and that wisdom will
die with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Virginians, I think that the mere name of
the State has also something to do with their pride in her.
To hear one of them enunciate the euphonious syllables when
asked to what portion of the Union he belongs, is wonderfully
edifying; it is as good as eating a peach. “<em>V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a</em>,” he
tells you, dwelling with rich intonations on the luscious vowels
and consonants,—in his mind doubtless the choicest in the
alphabet; and he seems proudly conscious, as he utters
them, of having spoken a charm which enwraps him in an
atmosphere of romance. Thenceforth he is unapproachable
on that verdurous ground, the envy and despair of all who
are so unfortunate as to have been born elsewhere. Thus a
rich word surrounds itself with rich associations. But suppose
a different name: instead of Virginia, Stubland, for example.
It might indeed be the best State of all, yet, believe me, <em>Stubland</em>
would have in all its borders no soil fertile enough to
grow the fine plant of State pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe,” said I, “there is but one State as proud as
Virginia, and that is the fiery little State of South Carolina.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have less respect for South Carolina,” said he, “than
for any other State in the Union. South Carolina troops
were the worst troops in the Confederate army. It was South
Carolina’s self-conceit and bluster that caused the war.”</p>

<p class='c000'>(So, State pride in another State than Virginia was only
“self-conceit.”)</p>

<p>TAKING THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Yes,” said I, “South Carolina began the war; but Virginia
carried it on. If Virginia had thrown the weight of her
very great power in the Union against secession, resort to
arms would never have been necessary. She held a position
which she has forfeited forever, because she was not true to it.
By seceding she lost wealth, influence, slavery, and the blood
of her bravest sons; and what has she gained? I wonder, sir,
how your State pride can hold out so well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Virginia,” he replied, with another gleam, his eyes doing
the fine frenzy again, “Virginia made the gallantest fight that
ever was; and I am prouder of her to-day than I ever was in
my life!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you are glad she is back in the Union again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To tell the truth, I am. I think more of the Union, too,
than I ever did before. It was a square, stand-up fight; we
got beaten, and I suppose it is all for the best. The very
hottest Secessionists are now the first to come back and offer
support to the government.” He tapped a little tin trunk he
carried. “I have fifty pardons here, which I am carrying
from Washington to Richmond, for men who, a year ago, you
would have said would drown themselves sooner than take
the oath of allegiance to the United States. It was a rich
sight to see these very men crowding to take the oath. It
was a bitter pill to some, and they made wry faces at it; but
the rest were glad enough to get back into the old Union. It
was like going home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What astonishes me,” said I, “after all the Southern
people’s violent talk about the last ditch,—about carrying on
an endless guerrilla warfare after their armies were broken up,
and fighting in swamps and mountains till the last man was
exterminated,—what astonishes me is, that they take so sensible
a view of their situation, and accept it so frankly; and
that you, a Rebel, and I, a Yankee, are sitting on this stage
talking over the bloody business so good-naturedly!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, it is astonishing, when you think of it! Southern
men and Northern men ride together in the trains, and stop at
the same hotels, as if we were all one people,—as indeed we
are: one nation now,” he added, “as we never were before,
and never could have been without the war.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>I got down at the hotel, washed and brushed away the dust
of travel, and went out to the dining-room. There the first
thing that met my eye was a pair of large wooden fans, covered
with damask cloth which afforded an ample flap to each, suspended
over the table, and set in motion by means of a rope
dropped from a pulley by the door. At the end of the rope
was a shining negro-boy about ten years old, pulling as if it
were the rope of a fire-bell, and the whole town were in flames.
The fans swayed to and fro, a fine breeze blew all up and down
the table, and not a fly was to be seen. I noticed before long,
however, that the little darkey’s industry was of an intermittent
sort; for at times he would cease pulling altogether,
until the landlady passed that way, when he would seem to
hear the cries of fire again, and once more fall to ringing his
silent alarm-bell in the most violent manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The landlady was the manager of the house; and I naturally
took her to be a widow until her husband was pointed out to
me,—a mere tavern lounger, of no account any way. It is
quite common to find Virginia hotels kept in this manner.
The wife does the work; the husband takes his ease in his inn.
The business goes in her name;—he is the sleeping partner.</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner I went out to view the town. As I stood
looking at the empty walls of the gutted court-house, a sturdy
old man approached. He stopped to answer my questions,
and pointing at the havoc made by shells, exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see the result of the vanity of Virginia!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you a Virginian!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am; but that is no reason why I should be blind to the
faults of my State. It was the vanity of Virginia, and nothing
else, that caused all our trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>(Here was another name for “State pride.”)</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were not very much in favor of secession, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In favor of it!” he exclaimed, kindling. “Didn’t they
have me in jail here nine weeks because I would not vote
for it? If I hadn’t been an old man, they would have hung
me. Ah, I told them how it would be, from the first; but
they wouldn’t believe me. Now they see! Look at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>ruined city! Look at the farms and plantations laid waste!
Look at the complete paralysis of business; the rich reduced
to poverty; the men and boys with one arm, one leg, or one
hand; the tens of thousands of graves; the broken families;—it
is all the result of vanity! vanity!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He showed me the road to the Heights, and we parted on
the corner.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIELD OF FREDERICKSBURG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Fredericksburg stands upon a ridge on the right bank of
the river. Behind the town is a plain, with a still more
elevated ridge beyond. From the summit of the last you
obtain an excellent view of the battle-field; the plain below the
town where Hooker fought; the heights on the opposite side
of the river manned by our batteries; the fields on the left;
and the plain between the ridge and the town, where the
frightfullest slaughter was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along by the foot of the crest, just where it slopes off to the
plain, runs a road with a wall of heavy quarried stones on each
side. In this road the Rebels lay concealed when the first
attempt was made to storm the Heights. The wall on the lower
side, towards the town, is the “stone wall” of history. It was
a perfect breastwork, of great strength, and in the very best
position that could have been chosen. The earth from the
fields is more or less banked up against it; and this, together
with the weeds and bushes which grew there, served to conceal
it from our men. The sudden cruel volley of flame and lead
which poured over it into their very faces, scarce a dozen paces
distant, as they charged, was the first intimation they received
of any enemy below the crest. No troops could stand that
near and deadly fire. They broke, and leaving the ground
strown with the fallen, retreated to the “ravine,”—a deep
ditch with a little stream flowing through it, in the midst of
the plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just when they turned to run, that was the worst time
for them!” said a young Rebel I met on the Heights. “Then
our men had nothing to fear; but they just rose right up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>let ’em have it! Every charge your troops made afterwards,
it was the same. The infantry in the road, and the artillery
on these Heights, just mowed them down in swaths! You
never saw anything look as that plain did after the battle.
Saturday morning, before the fight, it was brown; Sunday it
was all blue; Monday it was white, and Tuesday it was
red.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked him to explain this seeming riddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you see? Before the fight there was just the field.
Next it was covered all over with your fellows in blue clothes.
Saturday night the blue clothes were stripped off, and only
their white under-clothes left. Monday night these were
stripped off, and Tuesday they lay all in their naked skins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who stripped the dead in that way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was mostly done by the North Carolinians. They are
the triflin’est set of men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by <em>triflin’est</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They ha’n’t got no sense. They’ll stoop to anything.
They’re more like savages than civilized men. They say
‘<em>we ’uns</em>’ and ‘<em>you ’uns</em>,’ and all such outlandish phrases.
They’ve got a great long tone to their voice, like something
wild.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you in the battle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I was in all of Saturday’s fight. My regiment was
stationed on the hill down on the right there. We could see
everything. Your men piled up their dead for breastworks.
It was an awful sight when the shells struck them, and exploded!
The air, for a minute, would be just full of legs and
arms and pieces of trunks. Down by the road there we dug
out a wagon-load of muskets. They had been piled up by
your fellows, and dirt thrown over them, for a breastwork.
But the worst sight I saw was three days afterwards. I didn’t
mind the heaps of dead, nor nothing. But just a starving dog
sitting by a corpse, which he wouldn’t let anybody come near,
and which he never left night nor day;—by George, that just
made me cry! We finally had to shoot the dog to get at the
man to bury him.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The young Rebel thought our army might have been easily
destroyed after Saturday’s battle,—at least that portion of it
which occupied Fredericksburg. “We had guns on that
point that could have cut your pontoon bridge in two; and
then our artillery could have blown Burnside all to pieces, or
have compelled his surrender.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why didn’t you do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because General Lee was too humane. He didn’t want
to kill so many men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A foolish reason, but it was the best the young man could
offer. The truth is, however, Burnside’s army was in a position
of extreme danger, after its failure to carry the Heights,
and had not Lee been diligently expecting another attack, instead
of a retreat, he might have subjected it to infinite discomfiture.
It was to do us more injury, and not less, that he
delayed to destroy the pontoon bridge and shell the town while
our troops were in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man gloried in that great victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said I, “what did you gain? It was all the
worse for you that you succeeded then. That victory only
prolonged the war, and involved greater loss. We do not
look at those transient triumphs; we look at the grand result.
The Confederacy was finally swept out, and we are perfectly
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, so am I,” he replied, looking me frankly in the face.
“I tell you, if we had succeeded in establishing a separate
government, this would have been the worst country, for a
poor man, under the sun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There would have been no chance for white labor. Every
rich man would have owned his nigger mason, his nigger carpenter,
his nigger blacksmith; and the white mechanic, as
well as the white farm-laborer, would have been crushed out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think, then, the South will be better off without
slavery?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, I do. So does every white man that has to
work for a living, if he isn’t a fool.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Then why did you fight for it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We wasn’t fighting for slavery; we was fighting for our
independence. That’s the way the most of us understood it;
though we soon found out it was the rich man’s war, and not
the pore man’s. We was fighting against our own interests,
that’s shore!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a private cemetery on the crest, surrounded by a
brick wall. Burnside’s artillery had not spared it. I looked
over the wall, which was badly smashed in places, and saw
the overthrown monuments and broken tombstones lying on
the ground. The heights all around were covered with weeds,
and scarred by Rebel intrenchments; here and there was an
old apple-tree; and I marked the ruins of two or three small
brick houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the brow of the hill, overlooking the town, is the Marye
estate, one of the finest about Fredericksburg before the blast
of battle struck it. The house was large and elegant, occupying
a beautiful site, and surrounded by terraces and shady
lawns. Now if you would witness the results of artillery and
infantry firing, visit that house. The pillars of the porch,
built of brick, and covered with a cement of lime and white
sand, were speckled with the marks of bullets. Shells and
solid shot had made sad havoc with the walls and the wood-work
inside. The windows were shivered, the partitions torn
to pieces, and the doors perforated.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found a gigantic negro at work at a carpenter’s bench in
one of the lower rooms. He seemed glad to receive company,
and took me from the basement to the zinc-covered roof, showing
me all the more remarkable shot-holes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“De Rebel sharpshooters was in de house; dat’s what made
de Yankees shell it so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where were the people who lived here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey all lef’ but me. I stopped to see de fight. I tell
ye, I wouldn’t stop to see anoder one! I thought I was
go’n’ to have fine fun, and tell all about it. I <em>heerd</em> de fight,
but I didn’t <em>see</em> it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you frightened?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Hoo!” flinging up his hands with a ludicrous expression.
“Don’t talk about skeered! I never was so skeered since
I was bo’n! I stood hyer by dis sher winder; I ’spected to
see de whole of it; I know I was green! I was look’n’ to
see de fir’n’ down below dar, when a bullet come by me, <em>h’t</em>!
quick as dat. ‘Time fo’ me to be away f’om hyer!’ and
I started; but I’d no sooner turned about, when de bullets
begun to strike de house jes’ like dat!” drumming with his
fingers. “I went down-stars, and out dis sher house, quicker
’n any man o’ my size ever went out a house befo’e! Come,
and I’ll show you whar I was hid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the cellar of a little dairy-house, of which nothing
was left but the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I got in thar wid anoder cullud man. I thought I was
as skeered as anybody could be; but whew! he was twicet
as skeered as I was. B-r-r-r-r! b-r-r-r-r! de fir’n’ kep’ up a
reg’lar noise like dat, all day long. Every time a shell struck
anywhar near, I knowed de next would kill me. ‘Jim,’ says
I, ‘now de next shot will be our own!’ Dem’s de on’y wu’ds
I spoke; but he was so skeered he never spoke at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you here at the fight the year after?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat was when Shedwick [Sedgwick] come. I thought
if dar was go’n’ to be any fight’n’, I’d leave dat time, shore. I
hitched up my oxen, think’n’ I’d put out, but waited fo’ de
mo’nin’ to see. Dat was Sunday mo’nin’. I hadn’t slep’
none, so I jest thought I’d put my head on my hand a minute
till it growed light. I hadn’t mo’e ’n drapped asleep; I’d
nodded oncet or twicet: so;” illustrating; “no longer ’n dat;
when—c-r-r-r-r,—I looked up,—all de wu’ld was fir’n’!
Shedwick’s men dey run up de road, got behind de batteries
on dis sher hill, captured every one; and I never knowed how
dey done it so quick. Dat was enough fo’ me. If dar’s go’n’
to be any mo’e fight’n’, I go whar da’ an’t no wa’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A big fellow like you tell about being skeered!” said the
young Rebel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knowed de bigger a man was, de bigger de mark fo’ de
balls. I weighs two hundred and fifty-two pounds.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“Where is your master?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I ha’n’t got no master now; Mr. Marye was my master.
He’s over de mountain. I was sold at auction in Fredericksburg
oncet, and he bought me fo’ twelve hundred dolla’s.
Now he pays me wages,—thirty dolla’s a month. I wo’ked
in de mill while de wa’ lasted. Men brought me co’n to
grind. Some brought a gallon; some brought two qua’ts; it
was a big load if anybody brought half a bushel. Dat’s de
way folks lived. Now he’s got anoder man in de mill, and
he pays me for tak’n’ keer o’ dis sher place and fitt’n’ it up a
little.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you a carpenter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Somethin’ of a carpenter; I kin do whatever I turns my
hand to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Rebel afterwards corroborated this statement.
Although he did not like niggers generally, and wished they
were all out of the country, he said Charles (for that was the
giant’s name) was an exception; and he gave him high praise for
the fidelity and sagacity he had shown in saving his master’s
property from destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were sitting under the portico, a woman came up
the hill, and began to talk and jest in a familiar manner with
Charles. I noticed that my Rebel acquaintance looked exceedingly
disgusted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That woman,” said he to me, “has got a nigger husband.
That’s what makes her talk that way. White folks won’t
associate with her, and she goes with the darkies. We used to
have lynch law for them cases. Such things wa’n’t allowed.
A nigger had better have been dead than be caught living
with a white woman. The house would get torn down over
their heads some night, and nobody would know who did it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure such things were not allowed? Five out of
six of your colored population have white blood in their veins.
How do you account for it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“O, that comes from white fathers!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And slave mothers,” said I. “That I suppose was all
right; but to a stranger it doesn’t look very consistent. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>would lynch a poor black man for living in wedlock with a
white woman, and receive into the best society white men who
were raising up illegitimate slave children by their colored
mistresses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that’s just what was done; there’s no use denying
it. I’ve seen children sold at auction in Fredericksburg by
their own fathers. But nobody ever thought it was just right.
It always happened when the masters was in debt, and their
property had to be taken.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The field below the stone wall belonged to this young man’s
mother. It was now a cornfield; a sturdy crop was growing
where the dead had lain in heaps.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Soon as Richmond fell I came home; and ’Lijah and I
went to work and put in that piece of corn. I didn’t wait for
Lee’s surrender. Thousands did the same. We knew that
if Richmond fell, the war would be removed from Virginia, and
we had no notion of going to fight in other States. The Confederate
army melted away just like frost in the sun, so that
only a small part of it remained to be surrendered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He invited me to go through the cornfield and see where
the dead were buried. Near the middle of the piece a strip
some fifteen yards long and four wide had been left uncultivated.
“There’s a thousand of your men buried in this hole;
that’s the reason we didn’t plant here.” Some distance below
the cornfield was the cellar of an ice-house, in which five
hundred Union soldiers were buried. And yet these were
but a portion of the slain; all the surrounding fields were
scarred with graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to Fredericksburg, I visited the plain northwest
of the town, also memorable for much hard fighting on
that red day of December. I found a pack of government
wagons there, an encampment of teamsters, and a few Yankee
soldiers, who told me they were tired of doing nothing, and
“three times as fast for going home” as they were before the
war closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of this plain, shaded by a pleasant grove,
stands a brown brick mansion said to have been built by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>George Washington for his mother’s family. Not far off is a
monument erected to Mary, the mother of Washington, whose
mortal remains rest here. It is of marble, measuring some
nine feet square and fifteen in height, unfinished, capped with
a mat of weeds, and bearing no inscription but the names of
visitors who should have blushed to desecrate the tomb of the
venerated dead. The monument has in other ways been
sadly misused; in the first place, by balls which nicked and
chipped it during the battle; and afterwards by relic-hunters,
who, in their rage for carrying away some fragment of it, have
left scarce a corner of cornice or pilaster unbroken.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had afterwards many walks about Fredericksburg, the
most noteworthy of which was a morning-visit to the Lacy
House, where Burnside had his head-quarters. Crossing the
Rappahannock on the pontoon bridge, I climbed the stone
steps leading from terrace to terrace, and reached the long-neglected
grounds and the old-fashioned Virginia mansion. It
was entirely deserted. The doors were wide open, or broken
from their hinges, the windows smashed, the floors covered with
rubbish, and the walls with the names of soldiers and regiments,
or pictures cut from the illustrated newspapers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The windows command a view of Fredericksburg and the
battle-field; and there I stood, and saw in imagination the
fight reënacted,—the pontoniers at their work in the misty
morning, the sharpshooters in rifle-pits and houses opposite
driving them from it with their murderous fire, the shelling of
the town, the troops crossing, the terrible roaring battle, the
spouting flames, the smoke, the charging parties, and the horrible
slaughter;—I saw and heard it all again, and fancied
for a time that I was the commanding general, whose eyes
beheld, and whose wrung heart felt, what he would gladly
have given his own life to prevent or retrieve.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>TO CHANCELLORSVILLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In conversation with my Rebel acquaintance at the Marye
House, I had learned that his friend “’Lijah” sometimes conveyed
travellers over the more distant battle-fields. Him,
therefore, I sent to engage with his horse and buggy for the
following day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Breakfast was scarcely over the next morning, when, as I
chanced to look from my hotel-window, I saw a thin-faced
countryman drive up to the door in an old one-horse wagon
with two seats, and a box half filled with corn-stalks. I
was admiring the anatomy of the horse, every prominent
bone of which could be counted through his skin, when I
heard the man inquiring for me. It was “’Lijah,” with his
“horse and buggy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was inclined to criticise the establishment, which was not
altogether what I had been led to expect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I allow he a’n’t a fust-class hoss,” said Elijah. “Only
give three dollars for him. Feed is skurce and high. But
let him rest this winter, and git some meal in him, and he’ll
make a plough crack next spring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you going to do with those corn-stalks?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fodder for the hoss. They’re all the fodder he’ll git
till night; for we’re go’n’ into a country whar thar’s noth’n’
mo’e for an animal to eat than thar is on the palm of my hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I took a seat beside him, and made use of the stalks by
placing a couple of bundles between my back and the sharp
board which travellers were expected to lean against. Elijah
cracked his whip, the horse frisked his tail, and struck into a
cow-trot which pleased him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, he’ll snake us over the ground right peart!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>He proceeded to tantalize me by telling what a mule he
had, and what a little mare he had, at home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She certainly goes over the ground! I believe she can
run ekal to anything in this country for about a mile. But
she’s got a set of legs under her jest like a sheep’s legs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He could not say enough in praise of the mule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Paid eight hundred dollars for him in Confederate money.
He earned a living for the whole family last winter. I used
to go reg’lar up to Chancellorsville and the Wilderness, buy
up a box of clothing, and go down in Essex and trade it off
for corn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What sort of clothing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Soldiers’ clothes from the battle-fields. Some was flung
away, and some, I suppose, was stripped off the dead. Any
number of families jest lived on what they got from the Union
armies in that way. They’d pick up what garments they
could lay hands on, wash ’em up and sell ’em. I’d take a
blanket, and git half a bushel of meal for it down in Essex.
Then I’d bring the meal back, and git maybe two blankets,
or a blanket and a coat, for it. All with that little mule.
He’ll haul a load for ye! He’ll stick to the ground go’n’
up hill jest like a dry-land tarrapin! But I take the mare
when I’m in a hurry; she makes them feet rattle ag’in the
ground!”</p>

<p class='c000'>We took the plank-road to Chancellorsville, passing through
a waste country of weeds or undergrowth, like every other
part of Virginia which I had yet seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All this region through yer,” said Elijah, “used to be
grow’d up to corn and as beautiful clover as ever you see.
But since the wa’, it’s all turned out to bushes and briers and
hog-weeds. It’s gitt’n’ a start ag’in now. I’ll show ’em
how to do it. If we git in a crap o’ wheat this fall, which I
don’t know if we sha’n’t, we kin start three big teams, and
whirl up twenty acres of land directly. That mule,” etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Elijah praised the small farmers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“People in ordinary sarcumstances along yer are a mighty
industrious people. It’s the rich that keep this country down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The way it generally is, a few own too much, and the rest
own noth’n’. I know hundreds of thousands of acres of land
put to no uset, which, if it was cut up into little farms, would
make the country look thrifty. This is mighty good land;
clay bottom; holds manure jest like a chany bowl does water.
But the rich ones jest scratched over a little on’t with their
slave labor, and let the rest go. They wouldn’t sell; let a
young man go to ’em to buy, and they’d say they didn’t
want no poo’ whites around ’em; they wouldn’t have one, if
they could keep shet of ’em. And what was the result?
Young men would go off to the West, if they was enterpris’n’,
and leave them that wa’n’t enterpris’n’ hyer to home. Then
as the old heads died off, the farms would run down. The
young women would marry the lazy young men, and raise up
families of lazy children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The country all about Fredericksburg was very unhealthy.
Elijah, on making inquiries, could hear of scarcely a family on
the road exempt from sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was never so till sence the wa’. Now we have chills
and fever, jest like they do in a new country. It’s owin’ to
the land all comin’ up to weeds; the dew settles in ’em and
they rot, and that fills the air with the ager. I’ve had the
ager myself till about a fortnight ago; then soon as I got shet
of that, the colic took me. Eat too much on a big appetite, I
suppose. I like to live well; like to see plenty of everything
on the table, and then I like to see every man eat a heap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I commended Elijah’s practical sense; upon which he replied,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The old man is right ignorant; can’t read the fust letter;
never went to school a day; but the old man is right sharp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was fond of speaking of himself in this way. He thought
education a good thing, but allowed that all the education in
the world could not give a man sense. He was fifty years
old, and had got along thus far in life very well.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon thar’s go’n’ to be a better chance for the poo’
man after this. The Union bein’ held together was the greatest
thing that could have happened for us.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“And yet you fought against it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was in the Confederate army two year and a half. I was
opposed to secession; but I got my head a little turned after
the State went out, and I enlisted. Then, when I had time
to reconsider it all over, I diskivered we was wrong. I told
the boys so.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Boys,’ says I, ‘when my time’s up, I’m go’n’ out of
the army, and you won’t see me in ag’in.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You can’t help that, old man,’ says they; ‘fo’ by that
time the conscript law’ll be changed so’s to go over the heads
of older men than you.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Then,’ says I, ‘the fust chance presents itself, I fling
down my musket and go spang No’th.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“They had me put under arrest for that, and kep’ me in
the guard-house seven months. I liked that well enough. I
was saved a deal of hard march’n’ and lay’n’ out in the cold,
that winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Why don’t ye come in boys,’ says I, ‘and have a warm?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knowed what I was about! The old man was right
ignorant, but the old man was right sharp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed the line of Sedgwick’s retreat a few miles from
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shedrick’s men was in line acrost the road hyer, extendin’
into the woods on both sides; they had jest butchered their
meat, and was ishyin’ rations and beginnin’ to cook their
suppers, when Magruder struck ’em on the left flank.”
(Elijah was wrong; it was not Magruder, but McLaws.
These local guides make many such mistakes, and it is necessary
to be on one’s guard against them.) “They jest got
right up and skedaddled! The whole line jest faced to the
right, and put for Banks’s Ford. Thar’s the road they went.
They left it piled so full of wagons, Magruder couldn’t follah,
but his artillery jest run around by another road I’ll show ye,
hard as ever they could lay their feet to the ground, wheeled
their guns in position on the bluffs by the time Shedrick got
cleverly to crossin’, and played away. The way they heaped
up Shedrick’s men was awful!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Every mile or two we came to a small farm-house, commonly
of logs, near which there was usually a small crop of
corn growing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Every man after he got home, after the fall of Richmond,
put in to raise a little somethin’ to eat. Some o’ the corn
looks poo’ly, but it beats no corn at all, all to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We came to one field which Elijah pronounced a “monstrous
fine crap.” But he added,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve got thirty acres to home not a bit sorrier ’n that. Ye
see, that mule of mine,” etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>I noticed—what I never saw in the latitude of New England—that
the fodder had been pulled below the ears and
tied in little bundles on the stalks to cure. Ingenious shifts
for fences had been resorted to by the farmers. In some
places the planks of the worn-out plank-road had been staked
and lashed together to form a temporary enclosure. But the
most common fence was what Elijah called “bresh wattlin’.”
Stakes were first driven into the ground, then pine or cedar
brush bent in between them and beaten down with a maul.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye kin build a wattlin’ fence that way so tight a rabbit
can’t git through.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On making inquiries, I found that farms of fine land could
be had all through this region for ten dollars an acre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Elijah hoped that men from the North would come in and
settle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said he, “’t would be dangerous for any one to
take possession of a confiscated farm. He wouldn’t live a
month.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The larger land-owners are now more willing to sell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right smart o’ their property was in niggers; they’re
pore now, and have to raise money.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The emancipation of slavery,” added Elijah, “is wo’kin’
right for the country mo’e ways ’an one. The’ a’n’t two men
in twenty, in middlin’ sarcumstances, but that’s beginnin’
to see it. I’m no friend to the niggers, though. They ought
all to be druv out of the country. They won’t wo’k as long
as they can steal. I have my little crap o’ corn, and wheat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and po’k. When night comes, I must sleep; then the niggers
come and steal all I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I pressed him to give an instance of the negroes’ stealing
his property. He could not say that they had taken anything
from him lately, but they “used to” rob his cornfields and
hen-roosts, and “they would again.” Had he ever caught
them at it? No, he could not say that he ever had. Then
how did he know that the thieves were negroes? He knew
it, because “niggers would steal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Won’t white folks steal too, sometimes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said Elijah, “some o’ the poo’ whites are a durned
sight wus’n the niggers!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then why not drive them out of the country too? You
see,” said I, “your charges against the negroes are vague,
and amount to nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I own,” he replied, “thar’s now and then one that’s ekal
to any white man. Thar’s one a-comin’ thar.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A load of wood was approaching, drawn by two horses
abreast and a mule for leader. A white-haired old negro was
riding the mule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is the greatest man!” said Elijah, after we had passed.
“He’s been the support of his master’s family for twenty
year and over. He kin manage a heap better’n his master
kin. The’ a’n’t a farmer in the country kin beat him. He
keeps right on jest the same now he’s free; though I suppose
he gits wages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You acknowledge, then, that some of the negroes are
superior men?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, thar’s about ten in a hundred, honest and smart as
anybody.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That,” said I, “is a good many. Do you suppose you
could say more of the white race, if it had just come out of
slavery?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t believe,” said Elijah, “that ye could say as
much!”</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed the remains of the house “whar Harrow was
shot.” It had been burned to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“You’ve heerd about Harrow; he was Confederate commissary;
he stole mo’e hosses f’om the people, and po’ed the
money down his own throat, than would have paid fo’ fo’ty
men like him, if he was black.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A mile or two farther on, we came to another house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hyer’s whar the man lives that killed Harrow. He was
in the army, and because he objected to some of Harrow’s
doin’s, Harrow had him arrested, and treated him very much
amiss. That ground into his conscience and feelin’s, and he
deserted fo’ no other puppose than to shoot him. He’s a
mighty smart fellah! He’ll strike a man side the head, and
soon ’s his fist leaves it, his foot’s thar. He shot Harrow in
that house you see burnt to the ground, and then went spang
to Washington. O, he was sharp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>On our return we met the slayer of Harrow riding home
from Fredericksburg on a mule,—a fine-looking young fellow,
of blonde complexion, a pleasant countenance, finely chiselled
nose and lips, and an eye full of sunshine. “Jest the
best-hearted, nicest young fellah in the we’ld, till ye git him
mad; then look out!” I think it is often the most attractive
persons, of fine temperaments, who are capable of the most
terrible wrath when roused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plank-road was in such a ruined condition that nobody
thought of driving on it, although the dirt road beside it was
in places scarcely better. The back of the seat was cruel,
notwithstanding the corn-stalks. But by means of much
persuasion, enforced by a good whip, Elijah kept the old horse
jogging on. Oak-trees, loaded with acorns, grew beside the
road. Black-walnuts, already beginning to lose their leaves,
hung their delicate balls in the clear light over our heads.
Poke-weeds, dark with ripening berries, wild grapes festooning
bush and tree, sumachs thrusting up through the foliage
their sanguinary spears, persimmon-trees, gum-trees, red cedars,
with their bluish-green clusters, chestnut-oaks, and chincapins,
adorned the wild wayside.</p>

<p class='c000'>So we approached Chancellorsville, twelve miles from Fredericksburg.
Elijah was raised in that region, and knew everybody.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Many a frolic have I had runnin’ the deer through these
woods! Soon as the dogs started one, he’d put fo’ the river,
cross, take a turn on t’other side, and it wouldn’t be an hour
’fo’e he’d be back ag’in. Man I lived with used to have a
mare that was trained to hunt; if she was in the field and
heard the dogs, she’d whirl her tail up on her back, lope the
fences, and go spang to the United States Ford, git thar ’fo’e
the dogs would, and hunt as well without a rider as with
one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But since then a far different kind of hunting, a richer
blood than the deer’s, and other sounds than the exciting yelp
of the dogs, had rendered that region famous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hyer we come to the Chancellorsville farm. Many a
poo’ soldier’s knapsack was emptied of his clothes, after the
battle, along this road!” said Elijah, remembering last winter’s
business with his mule.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road runs through a large open field bounded by woods.
The marks of hard fighting were visible from afar off. A
growth of saplings edging the woods on the south had been
killed by volleys of musketry: they looked like thickets of
bean-poles. The ground everywhere, in the field and in the
woods, was strewed with mementos of the battle,—rotting
knapsacks and haversacks, battered canteens and tin cups, and
fragments of clothing which Elijah’s customers had not deemed
it worth the while to pick up. On each side of the road were
breastworks and rifle-pits extending into the woods. The
clearing, once a well-fenced farm of grain-fields and clover-lots,
was now a dreary and deserted common. Of the Chancellorsville
House, formerly a large brick tavern, only the
half-fallen walls and chimney-stacks remained. Here General
Hooker had his head-quarters until the wave of battle on
Sunday morning rolled so hot and so near that he was compelled
to withdraw. The house was soon after fired by a
Rebel shell, when full of wounded men, and burned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Every place ye see these big bunches of weeds, that’s
whar tha’ was hosses or men buried,” said Elijah. “These
holes are whar the bones have been dug up for the bone-factory
at Fredericksburg.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>It was easy for the bone-seekers to determine where to dig.
The common was comparatively barren, except where grew
those gigantic clumps of weeds. I asked Elijah if he thought
many human bones went to the factory.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not unless by mistake. But people a’n’t always very partic’lar
about mistakes thar’s money to be made by.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing a small enclosure midway between the road and the
woods on the south, we walked to it, and found it a burying-ground
ridged with unknown graves. Not a head-board, not
an inscription, indicated who were the tenants of that little
lonely field. And Elijah knew nothing of its history; it had
been set apart, and the scattered dead had been gathered together
and buried there, since he passed that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found breastworks thrown up all along by the plank-road
west of the farm,—the old worn planks having been put
to good service in their construction. The tree-trunks pierced
by balls, the boughs lopped off by shells, the strips of timber
cut to pieces by artillery and musketry fire, showed how desperate
the struggle on that side had been. The endeavors of
the Confederates to follow up with an overwhelming victory
Jackson’s swift and telling blows on our right, and the equally
determined efforts of our men to retrieve that disaster, rendered
this the scene of a furious encounter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Elijah thought that if Jackson had not been killed by his
own men after delivering that thunderstroke, Hooker would
have been annihilated. “Stonewall” was undoubtedly the
enemy’s best fighting General. His death was to them equal
to the loss of many brigades. With regard to the manner of
his death there can be no longer any doubt. I have conversed
with Confederate officers who were in the battle, all of whom
agree as to the main fact. General Jackson, after shattering our
right wing, posted his pickets at night with directions to fire
upon any man or body of men that might approach. He afterwards
rode forward to reconnoitre, returned inadvertently by
the same road, and was shot by his own orders.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE WILDERNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Battle of Bull Run in 1861, Pope’s campaign, and
Burnside’s defeat at Fredericksburg in 1862, and, lastly,
Hooker’s unsuccessful attempt at Chancellorsville in the spring
of 1863, had shown how hard a road to Richmond this was to
travel. Repeatedly, as we tried it and failed, the hopes of the
Confederacy rose exultant; the heart of the North sank as
often, heavy with despair. McClellan’s Peninsular route had
resulted still more fatally. We all remember the anguish and
anxiety of those days. But the heart of the North shook off
its despair, listened to no timid counsels; it was growing fierce
and obdurate. We no longer received the news of defeat with
cries of dismay, but with teeth close-set, a smile upon the quivering
lips, and a burning fire within. Had the Rebels triumphed
again? Then so much the worse for them! Had we been
once more repulsed with slaughter from their strong line of
defences? Was the precious blood poured out before them all
in vain? At last it should not be in vain! Though it should
cost a new thirty years’ war and a generation of lives, the red
work we had begun must be completed; ultimate failure was
impossible, ultimate triumph certain.</p>

<p class='c000'>This inflexible spirit found its embodiment in the leader of
the final campaigns against the Rebel capital. It was the deep
spirit of humanity itself, ready to make the richest sacrifices,
calm, determined, inexorable, moving steadily towards the
great object to be achieved. It has been said that General
Grant did not consider the lives of his men. Then the people
did not consider them. But the truth lies here: precious as
were those lives, something lay beyond far more precious, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>they were the needful price paid for it. We had learned the
dread price, we had duly weighed the worth of the object to be
purchased; what then was the use of hesitating and higgling?</p>

<p class='c000'>We were approaching the scene of Grant’s first great blow
aimed at the gates of the Rebel capital. On the field of
Chancellorsville you already tread the borders of the field of
the Wilderness,—if that can be called a field which is a mere
interminable forest, slashed here and there with roads.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing straight along the plank-road, we came to a large
farm-house, which had been gutted by soldiers, and but recently
reoccupied. It was still in a scarcely habitable condition.
However, we managed to obtain, what we stood greatly
in need of, a cup of cold water. I observed that it tasted
strongly of iron.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The reason of that is, we took twelve camp-kettles out of
the well,” said the man of the house, “and nobody knows how
many more there are down there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The place is known as Locust Grove. In the edge of the
forest, but a little farther on, is the Wilderness Church,—a
square-framed building, which showed marks of such usage
as every uninhabited house receives at the hands of a wild
soldiery. Red Mars has little respect for the temples of the
Prince of Peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many a time have I been to meet’n’ in that shell, and sot
on hard benches, and heard long sermons!” said Elijah.
“But I reckon it’ll be a long while befo’e them doo’s are
darkened by a congregation ag’in. Thar a’n’t the population
through hyer thar used to be. Oncet we’d have met a hundred
wagons on this road go’n’ to market; but I count we
ha’n’t met mo’e ’n a dozen to-day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Not far beyond the church we approached two tall guide-posts
erected where the road forks. The one on the right
pointed the way to the “Wilderness National Cemetery, No.
1, 4 miles,” by the Orange Court-House turnpike. The other
indicated the “Wilderness National Cemetery, No. 2,” by the
plank-road.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All this has been done sence I was this way,” said Elijah.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>We kept the plank-road,—or rather the clay road beside it,
which stretched before us dim in the hollows, and red as brick
on the hill-sides. We passed some old fields, and entered the
great Wilderness,—a high and dry country, thickly overgrown
with dwarfish timber, chiefly scrub oaks, pines, and
cedars. Poles lashed to trees for tent-supports indicated where
our regiments had encamped; and soon we came upon
abundant evidences of a great battle. Heavy breastworks
thrown up on Brock’s cross-road, planks from the plank-road
piled up and lashed against trees in the woods, to form a shelter
for our pickets, knapsacks, haversacks, pieces of clothing, fragments
of harness, tin plates, canteens, some pierced with balls,
fragments of shells, with here and there a round-shot, or a
shell unexploded, straps, buckles, cartridge-boxes, socks, old
shoes, rotting letters, desolate tracts of perforated and broken
trees,—all these signs, and others sadder still, remained to
tell their silent story of the great fight of the Wilderness.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cloud passed over the sun: all the scene became sombre,
and hushed with a strange brooding stillness, broken only by
the noise of twigs crackling under my feet, and distant growls
of thunder. A shadow fell upon my heart also, as from the
wing of the Death-Angel, as I wandered through the woods,
meditating upon what I saw. Where were the feet that wore
those empty shoes? Where was he whose proud waist was
buckled in that belt? Some soldier’s heart was made happy
by that poor, soiled, tattered, illegible letter, which rain and
mildew have not spared; some mother’s, sister’s, wife’s, or
sweetheart’s hand, doubtless, penned it; it is the broken end
of a thread which unwinds a whole life-history, could we but
follow it rightly. Where is that soldier now? Did he fall in
the fight, and does his home know him no more? Has the
poor wife or stricken mother waited long for the answer to that
letter, which never came, and will never come? And this
cap, cut in two by a shot, and stiff with a strange incrustation,—a
small cap, a mere boy’s, it seems,—where now the fair
head and wavy hair that wore it? Oh, mother and sisters at
home, do you still mourn for your drummer-boy? Has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>story reached you,—how he went into the fight to carry off
his wounded comrades, and so lost his life for their sakes?—for
so I imagine the tale which will never be told.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what more appalling spectacle is this? In the cover
of thick woods, the unburied remains of two soldiers,—two
skeletons side by side, two skulls almost touching each other,
like the cheeks of sleepers! I came upon them unawares as I
picked my way among the scrub oaks. I knew that scores of
such sights could be seen here a few weeks before; but the
United States Government had sent to have its unburied dead
collected together in the two national cemeteries of the Wilderness;
and I had hoped the work was faithfully done.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They was No’th-Carolinians; that’s why they didn’t bury
’em,” said Elijah, after a careful examination of the buttons
fallen from the rotted clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ground where they lay had been fought over repeatedly,
and the dead of both sides had fallen there. The buttons
may, therefore, have told a true story: North-Carolinians they
may have been; yet I could not believe that the true reason
why they had not been decently interred. It must have been
that these bodies, and others we found afterwards, were overlooked
by the party sent to construct the cemeteries. It was
shameful negligence, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cemetery was near by,—a little clearing in the woods
by the roadside, thirty yards square, surrounded by a picket
fence, and comprising seventy trenches, each containing the
remains of I know not how many dead. Each trench was
marked with a head-board inscribed with the invariable words:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unknown United States soldiers, killed May, 1864.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Elijah, to whom I read the inscription, said, pertinently, that
the words <em>United States soldiers</em> indicated plainly that it had
not been the intention to bury Rebels there. No doubt: but
these might at least have been buried in the woods where they
fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a grim sarcasm on this neglect, somebody had flung three
human skulls, picked up in the woods, over the paling into the
cemetery, where they lay blanching among the graves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Close by the southeast corner of the fence were three or
four Rebel graves with old head-boards. Elijah called my
attention to them, and wished me to read what the head-boards
said. The main fact indicated was, that those buried there
were North-Carolinians. Elijah considered this somehow
corroborative of his theory derived from the buttons. The
graves were shallow, and the settling of the earth over the
bodies had left the feet of one of the poor fellows sticking out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shadows which darkened the woods, and the ominous
thunder-growls, culminated in a shower. Elijah crawled under
his wagon; I sought the shelter of a tree; the horse champed
his fodder, and we ate our luncheon. How quietly upon the
leaves, how softly upon the graves of the cemetery, fell the
perpendicular rain! The clouds parted, and a burst of sunlight
smote the Wilderness; the rain still poured, but every
drop was illumined, and I seemed standing in a shower of silver
meteors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rain over, and luncheon finished, I looked about for
some solace to my palate after the dry sandwiches moistened
only by the drippings from the tree,—seeking a dessert in the
Wilderness. Summer grapes hung their just ripened clusters
from the vine-laden saplings, and the chincapin bushes were
starred with opening burrs. I followed a woodland path
embowered with the glistening boughs, and plucked, and ate,
and mused. The ground was level, and singularly free from
the accumulations of twigs, branches, and old leaves with
which forests usually abound. I noticed, however, many
charred sticks and half-burnt roots and logs. Then the terrible
recollection overtook me: these were the woods that were on
fire during the battle. I called Elijah.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, all this was a flame of fire while the fight was go’n’
on. It was full of dead and wounded men. Cook and Stevens,
farmers over hyer, men I know, heard the screams of
the poor fellahs burnin’ up, and come and dragged many a one
out of the fire, and laid ’em in the road.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The woods were full of Rebel graves, with here and there
a heap of half-covered bones, where several of the dead had
been hurriedly buried together.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>I had seen enough. We returned to the cemetery. Elijah
hitched up his horse, and we drove back along the plank-road,
cheered by a rainbow which spanned the Wilderness and
moved its bright arch onward over Chancellorsville towards
Fredericksburg, brightening and fading, and brightening still
again, like the hope which gladdened the nation’s eye after
Grant’s victory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Elijah wished to drive me the next day to Spottsylvania
Court-House, and, as an inducement for me to employ him,
promised to tackle up his mare. He also proposed various
devices for softening the seats of his wagon. No ingenuity
of plan, however, sufficed to cajole me. There was a livery-stable
in Fredericksburg, and I had conceived a strong prejudice
in its favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, accordingly, there might have been seen
wheeling up to the tavern-door a shining vehicle,—a bran-new
buggy with the virgin gloss upon it,—drawn by a
prancing iron-gray in a splendid new harness. The sarcastic
stable-man had witnessed my yesterday’s departure and return,
and had evidently exhausted the resources of his establishment
to furnish forth a dazzling contrast to Elijah’s sorry outfit.
The driver was a youth who wore his cap rakishly over his
left eyebrow. I took a seat by his side on a cushion of the
softest, and presently might have been seen riding out of Fredericksburg
in that brilliant style,—nay, <em>was</em> seen, by one
certainly, who was cut to the heart. We drove by the “stonewall”
road under the Heights, and passed a house by the
corner of which a thin-visaged “old man” of fifty was watering
a sad little beast at a well. The beast was “that mare”; and
the old man was Elijah. I shall never forget the look he gave
me. I bade him a cheerful good-morning; but his voice stuck
in his throat; he could not say “good-morning.” Our twinkling
wheels almost grazed the hubs of the old wagon standing
in the road as we passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>That I might have nothing to regret, the stable-keeper had
given me a driver who was in the Spottsylvania battle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“You cannot have seen much service, at your age,” I said,
examining his boyish features.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was four year in de army, anyhow,” he replied, spitting
tobacco-juice with an air of old experience. “I enlisted when
I was thirteen. I was under de quartermaster at fust; but de
last two year I was in de artillery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I observed that he used <em>de</em> for <em>the</em> almost invariably, with
many other peculiarities of expression which betrayed early
association with negroes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Richard H. Hicks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is your middle name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I ha’n’t got no middle name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What does the <em>H</em> stand for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>H</em> stands for Hicks: Richard H. Hicks; dat’s what dey
tell me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t you read?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I can’t read. I never went to school, and never had
no chance to learn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow this confession touched me with a sadness I had
not felt even at the sight of the dead men in the woods. He,
young, active, naturally intelligent, was dead to a world without
which this world would seem to us a blank,—the world
of literature. To him the page of a book, the column of a
newspaper, was meaningless. Had he been an old man, or
black, or stupid, I should not have been so much surprised.
I thought of Shakspeare, David, the prophets, the poets, the
romancers; and as my mind glanced from name to name on
the glittering entablatures, I seemed to be standing in a glorious
temple, with a blind youth at my side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Scott?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I never heerd of that Scott. But I know a William
Scott.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you ever hear of Longfellow?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I never heerd of him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you never hear of a great English poet called Lord
Byron?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“No, sir, I never knowed dar was such a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>What a gulf betwixt his mind and mine! Sitting side by
side there, we were yet as far apart as the great globe’s poles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to go through life in such ignorance?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know; I’d learn to read if I had de chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Find a chance! make a chance! Even the little negro
boys are getting the start of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon I’ll go to school some dis winter,” said he.
“Dar’s go’n’ to be a better chance fo’ schools now; dat’s
what dey say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why now?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know; on’y dey say so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think, then, it was a good thing that the Confederacy
got used up and slavery abolished?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It mought be a good thing. All I know is, it’s so, and it
can’t be ho’ped” (helped). “It suits me well enough. I’ve
been gitt’n’ thirty dollars a month dis summer, and that’s
twicet mo’e ’n I ever got befo’e.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not discover that this youth of seventeen had ever
given the great questions involving the welfare of his country
a serious thought. However, the vague belief he had imbibed
regarding better times coming in consequence of emancipation,
interested me as a still further evidence of the convictions
entertained by the poorer classes on this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we rode over the hills behind Fredericksburg, a young
fellow came galloping after us on a mule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar ye go’n’, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m go’n’ to de battle-field wi’ dis gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s from the No’th, then,” said the young fellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you know that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because no South’n man ever goes to the battle-fields: we’ve
seen enough of ’em.” He became very sociable as we rode
along. “Ye see that apple-tree? I got a right good pair o’
pants off one o’ your soldier’s under that tree once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was he dead?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. He was one of Sedgwick’s men; he was killed when
Sedgwick took the Heights. Shot through the head. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>pants wa’n’t hurt none.” And putting spurs to his mule, he
galloped ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>I noticed that he and Richard, like many of the young men,
white and black, I had seen about Fredericksburg, wore United
States army trousers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey was all we could git one while,” said Richard. “I
reckon half our boys ’u’d have had to go widout pants if it
had n’t been for de Union army. Dar was right smart o’
trad’n’ done in Yankee clothes, last years o’ de wa’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you rob a dead soldier of those you have on?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; I bought dese in Fredericksburg. I never robbed a
dead man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how did you know they were not taken from a
corpse?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mought be; but it couldn’t be ho’ped. A poo’ man can’t
be choice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Richard expressed great contempt—inspired by envy, I
thought—of the young chap riding the mule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“United States gov’ment give away a hundred and fifty
old wore-out mules in Fredericksburg, not long ago; so now
every lazy fellow ye see can straddle his mule! He a’n’t nobody,
though he thinks he’s a heavy coon-dog!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by a <em>heavy coon-dog</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, ye see, when a man owns a big plantation, and a
heap o’ darkeys, and carries a heavy pocket, or if he’s do’n’ a
big thing, den we call him a heavy coon-dog. Jeff Davis was
a heavy coon-dog; but he’s a light coon-dog now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our route lay through a rough, hilly country, never more
than very thinly inhabited, and now scarcely that. About
every two miles we passed a poor log house in the woods, or
on the edge of overgrown fields,—sometimes tenantless, but
oftener occupied by a pale, poverty-smitten family afflicted with
the chills. I do not remember more than two or three framed
houses on the road, and they looked scarcely less disconsolate
than their log neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is twelve miles from Fredericksburg to Spottsylvania
Court-House. At the end of nine or ten miles we began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>meet with signs of military operations,—skirmish-lines, rifle-pits,
and graves by the roadside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rising a gentle ascent, we had a view of the Court-House,
and of the surrounding country,—barren, hilly fields, with
here and there a scattered tree, or clump of trees, commonly
pines, and boundaries of heavier timber beyond. There were
breastworks running in various directions,—along by the road,
across the road, and diagonally over the crests. The country
was all cut up with them; and I found the Rebel works strangely
mixed up with our own. As our army advanced, it had possessed
itself of the enemy’s rifle-pits, skirmish-line, and still
more important intrenchments, and converted them to its own
use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grant’s main line of breastworks, very heavy, constructed
of rails and stakes and earth, crosses the road at nearly right
angles, and stretches away out of sight on either side over the
hills and into the woods. I was reminded of what Elijah had
told me the day before at Brock’s Road, in the Wilderness.
“Grant’s breastworks run thirty miles through the country,
from near Ely’s Ford on the Rapidan, spang past Spottsylvany
Court-House and the Mattapony River.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The road to the Court-House runs south. On the left was
Beverly’s house, and a shattered empty house on the right.
Richard pointed out the hill on which his battery was stationed
early in the battle. “We had to git away f’om dar, though.
Your batteries drove us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode on to the Court-House: a goodly-brick building, with
heavy pillars in front, one of which had been broken off by a
shell, leaving a corner of the portico hanging in the air. There
were but six other buildings of any importance in the place,—one
jail, one tavern, (no school-house,) one private dwelling,
and three churches; all of brick, and all more or less battered
by artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Entering the Court-House amid heaps of rubbish which littered
the yard about the doors, I had the good fortune to find
the county clerk at his desk. He received me politely, and
offered to show me about the building. It had been well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>riddled by shot and shell; but masons and carpenters were at
work repairing damages; so that there was a prospect of the
county, in a few months, having a court-house again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is most to be regretted,” the clerk said, “is the
destruction of documents which can’t be restored. All the
records and papers of the court were destroyed by the Union
soldiers after they got possession.” And he showed me a
room heaped with the fragments. It looked like a room in a
rag-man’s warehouse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to his office, he invited me to sit down, and commenced
talking freely of the condition and prospects of the
country. The area of corn-land planted was small; but the
soil had been resting two or three years, the season had
been favorable, and the result was an excellent crop. “We
shall probably have a surplus to dispose of for other necessaries.”
The county had not one third the number of horses,
nor one tenth the amount of stock, it had before the war.
Many families were utterly destitute. They had nothing
whatever to live upon until the corn-harvest; and many would
have nothing then. The government had been feeding as
many as fifteen hundred persons at one time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many of these were blacks?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps one fifth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How large a proportion of the population of the county
are blacks?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not quite one half.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The colored population require proportionately less assistance,
then, than the white?” He admitted the fact. “How
happens it?” I inquired; for he had previously told me the
old hackneyed tale, that the negroes would not work, and that
in consequence they were destined to perish like the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ll steal,” said he; and he made use of this expression,
which he said was proverbial: “An honest nigger is as
rare as a lock of har on the palm of my hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” I objected, “it seems hardly possible for one class
of people to live by stealing in a country you describe as so
destitute.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“A nigger will live on almost nothing,” he replied. “It
isn’t to be denied, however, but that some of them work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He criticised severely the government’s system of feeding
the destitute. “Hundreds are obtaining assistance who are
not entitled to any. They have only to go to the overseers
of the poor appointed by government, put up a poor mug, and
ask for a certificate in a weak voice; they get it, and come
and draw their rations. Some draw rations both here and at
Fredericksburg, thus obtaining a double support, while they
are well able to work and earn their living, if left to themselves.
The system encourages idleness, and does more harm than good.
All these evils could be remedied, and more than half the expense
saved the government, if it would intrust the entire management
of the matter in the hands of citizens.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it the whites, or the blacks, who abuse the government’s
bounty?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The whites.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It appears, then, that they have the same faults you ascribe
to the blacks: they are not over-honest, and they will not
work unless obliged to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, there are shiftless whites to be sure. There’s a
place eight miles west from here, known as Texas, inhabited
by a class of poor whites steeped in vice, ignorance, and crime
of every description. They have no comforts, and no energy
to work and obtain them. They have no books, no morality,
no religion; they go clothed like savages, half sheltered, and
half fed,—except that government is now supporting them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do the whites we are feeding come mostly from that
region?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“O, no; they come from all over the county. Some walk
as far as twenty miles to draw their fortnight’s or three weeks’
rations. Some were in good circumstances before the war;
and some are tolerably well off now. A general impression
prevails that this support comes from a tax on the county;
so every man, whether he needs it or not, rushes in for a
share. It is impossible to convince the country people that
it is the United States government that is feeding them. Why,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>sir, there are men in the back districts who will not yet
believe that the war is over, and slavery at an end!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It appears,” said I, “that ignorance is not confined to the
region you call Texas; and that, considering all things, the
whites are even more degraded than the blacks. Why
doesn’t some prophet of evil arise and predict that the white
race, too, will die out because it is vicious and will not
work?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The whites are a different race, sir,—a different race,”
was the emphatic, but not very satisfactory reply. “The
negro cannot live without the care and protection of a master.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think, then, the abolition of slavery a great misfortune?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A great misfortune to the negroes, certainly; but not to
the whites: we shall be better off without them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is singular that the negroes have no fear of the fate you
predict for them. They say, on the contrary, ‘We have been
supporting our masters and their families all our lives, and now
it is a pity if we cannot earn a living for ourselves.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I hope they will succeed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the reply the emancipated slave-owners almost invariably
make to the above argument; sometimes sarcastically,
sometimes gravely, sometimes commiseratingly, but always incredulously.
“The negro is fated;” this is the real or pretended
belief; and this they repeat, often with an ill-concealed
spirit of vindictiveness, an “I-told-you-so!” air of triumph,
until one is forced to the conclusion that their prophecy is
their desire.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIELD OF SPOTTSYLVANIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I walked on to the tavern where Richard H. Hicks
was baiting his horse. The landlord took me to a lumber-room
where he kept, carefully locked up, a very remarkable
curiosity. It was the stump of a tree, eleven inches in diameter,
which had been cut off by bullets—not by cannon-shot,
but by leaden bullets—in the Spottsylvania fight. It looked
like a colossal scrub-broom. “I had a stump twice as big as
this, cut off by bullets in the same way, only much smoother;
but some Federal officers took it from me and sent it to the
War Department at Washington.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had many battle-scars about his house to show; one of
which I remember: “A shell come in through the wall thar,
wrapped itself up in a bed that stood hyer, and busted in five
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In one of the rooms I found a Union officer lying on a
lounge, sick with the prevailing fever. He seemed glad to
see a Northern face, and urged me to be seated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is fearfully lonesome here; and just now I have no
companion but the ague.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Learning that he had been some time in command of the
post, I inquired the reason why the citizens appeared so eager
to save the government expense in feeding their poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very simple: they wish to get control of the business
in order to cut off the negroes. They had rather have the
assistance the government affords withdrawn altogether, than
that the freedmen should come in for a share. It is their
policy to keep the blacks entirely dependent upon their former
masters, and consequently as much slaves as before.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“You of course hear many complaints that the blacks will
not work?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, and they are true in certain cases: they will not work
for such wages as their late owners are willing to give; in other
words, they will not work for less than nothing. But when
they have encouragement they work very well, in their fashion,—which
is not the Yankee fashion, certainly, but the fashion
which slavery has bred them up to. They have not yet learned
to appreciate, however, the binding character of a contract. It
is a new thing to them. Besides, the master too often sets
them bad examples by failing to keep his own engagements.
He has been in the habit of breaking his promises to them at
his convenience; and now he finds fault that they do not keep
theirs any better. The masters have not yet learned how to
treat their old servants under the new conditions. They cannot
learn that they are no longer slaves. That is one great source
of trouble. On the other hand, where the freedman receives
rational, just, and kind treatment, he behaves well and works
well, almost without exception. I expect a good deal of difficulty
soon. The negroes have in many places made contracts
to work for a part of the crop; now when the corn comes to
be divided, their ideas and their master’s, with regard to what
‘a part’ of the crop is, will be found to differ considerably. I
was not an anti-slavery man at home,” he added; “and I give
you simply the results of my observation since I have been in
the South.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think would be the effect if our troops were
withdrawn?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hardly know; but I should expect one of two things:
either that the freedmen would be reduced to a worse condition
than they were ever in before, or that they would rise in insurrection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The landlord wished me to go and look at his corn. It was
certainly a noble crop. The tops of the monstrous ears towered
six or eight feet from the ground; the tops of the stalks at
least twelve or fourteen feet. He maintained that it would
average fifty bushels (of shelled corn) to the acre. I thought
the estimate too high.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Good corn,” said he, “measures finely; sorry corn porely.
And consider, not a spoonful of manure has been put on this
ground fo’ fou’ years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the ground has been resting; and that is as good as
manure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; but it’s mighty good soil that will do as well as this.
Now tell your people, if they want to buy good land cheap,
hyer’s their chance. I’ve got a thousand acres; and I’ll
sell off seven hundred acres, claired or timber land, to suit purchasers.
It’s well wo’th twenty dollars an acre; I’ll sell for
ten. It a’n’t fur from market; and thar’s noth’n’ ye can’t
raise on this yer land.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of all his thousand acres he had only about fifteen under
cultivation. His cornfield was not as large as it appeared;
for, running through the centre of it, like a titanic furrow,
were Lee’s tremendous intrenchments. These few acres were
all the old man had been able to enclose. There was not
another fence on his farm. “I had over ten thousand panels
of fence burnt up for me during the wa’; over eighty thousand
rails.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By which army?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Both: fust one, and then the other. Our own troops were
as bad as the Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards, as we rode away from the tavern, Richard H.
Hicks gave me the following succinct account of the landlord:</p>

<p class='c000'>“He used to be a heavy coon-dog. He had fifty head o’
darkeys. He wouldn’t hire ’em, and dey lef’. Now he has
nobody to wo’k de land, he’s got a light pocket, and so he’s a
mind to sell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding west from the Court-House, and striking across the
fields on the right, we passed McCool’s house, in a pleasant
shady place, and reached the scene where the eight days’ fighting
culminated. Of the woods, thinned and despoiled by the
storm of iron and lead, only a ghostly grove of dead trunks
and dreary dry limbs remained. Keeping around the western
edge of these, we came to a strange medley of intrenchments,
which it would have required an engineer to unravel and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>understand. Here Grant’s works had been pushed up against
Lee’s, swallowing them as one wave swallows another. Nowhere
else have I seen evidences of such close and desperate
fighting. For eight days Grant had been thundering at the
gates of the Confederacy; slowly, with fearful loss, he had been
pressing back the enemy and breaking through the obstructions;
until here at last he concentrated all his strength. Each
army fought as if the gods had decreed that the issue of the
war depended upon that struggle. And so indeed they had:
the way to Richmond by this route, so long attempted in vain,
was here opened. The grand result proclaimed that the eight
days’ battles were victories; that the enemy, for the first time
on his own chosen ground, had met with ominous defeat. Inconceivable
was the slaughter. Here two red rivers met and
spilled themselves into the ground. Swift currents from the
great West, tributaries from the Atlantic States and from the
Lake States, priceless rills, precious drops, from almost every
community and family in the Union, swelled the northern
stream which burst its living banks and perished here. Every
state, every community, every family mourned.</p>

<p class='c000'>But behind this curtain of woe was the chiselled awful form,
the terrible front and sublime eyes, of the statue of Fate, the nation’s
unalterable Will. Contemplating that, we were silenced,
if not consoled. Every breast—that of the father going to
search for the body of his dead son, that of the mother reading
the brief despatch that pierced her as the bullet pierced her
dear boy, that of the pale wife hastening to the cot-side of her
dying husband, nay, the bleeding breasts of the wounded and
dying, while yet they felt a throb of life—thrilled responsive
to Grant’s simple, significant announcement—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I propose to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It took all summer, indeed, and all winter too; but the result
had been decided at Spottsylvania.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rebel armies had invaded the North and been driven
ingloriously back. Many times we had started for Richmond
and been repulsed. But at length we were not repulsed:
the overwhelming wave poured over the embankments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Such thoughts—or rather deep emotions, of which such
thoughts are but the feeble expression—possess the serious
tourist, who stands upon that field furrowed and ridged with
earthworks and with graves,—beside that grove of shattered
and shrivelled trees. A conscious solemnity seems brooding in
the air. If the intrenchments could speak, what a history
could they disclose! But those sphinx-like lips of the earth
are rigid and still. Even the winds seem to hush their
whispers about that scene of desolation. All is silence; and
the heart of the visitor is constrained to silence also.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon a hacked and barkless trunk at the angle of the
woods, in the midst of the graves, was nailed aloft a board
bearing these lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On Fame’s eternal camping-ground</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their silent tents are spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glory guards with solemn round</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The bivouac of the dead.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A thick undergrowth had sprung up in the woods. I
noticed, stooping among the bushes along by the breastworks,
an old woman and two young girls.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey ’re chincapinnin’,” said Richard.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I observed that they gathered the nuts, not from the
bushes, but from the ground. Curiosity impelled me to follow
them. The woman had a haversack slung at her side; one of
the girls carried an open pail. They passed along the intrenchments,
searching intently, and occasionally picking something
out of the dirt. Pressing into the bushes, I accosted them.
They scarcely deigned to look at me, but continued their
strange occupation. I questioned them about the battle; but
their answers were as vague and stupid as if they then heard
of it for the first time. Meanwhile I obtained a glance at the
open mouth of the heavily freighted haversack and the half-filled
pail, and saw not chincapins, but several quarts of old
bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wandering along by the intrenchments, I observed the half-rotted
fragments of a book on the ground. They were leaves
from a German pocket Testament, which doubtless some soldier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>had carried into the fight. I picked them up, and glanced my
eye over the mildewed pages. By whom were they last
perused? What poor immigrant’s heart, fighting here the
battles of his adopted country, had drawn consolation from
those words of life, which lose not their vitality in any language?
What was the fate of that soldier? Was he now telling
the story of his campaigns to his bearded comrades, wife and
children; or was that tongue forever silent in the dust of the
graves that surrounded me? While I pondered, these words
caught my eye:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die du mir gegeben hast, die habe ich bewahret, und ist
keiner von ihnen verloren.</span>”—“Those that thou gavest me I
have kept, and none of them is lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked round upon the graves; I thought of the patriot
hosts that had fallen on these fearful battle-fields,—of the
households bereft, of the husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons,
who went down to the Wilderness and were never heard of
more; and peace and solace, sweet as the winds of Paradise,
came to me in these words, as I repeated them,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“None of them is lost, none of them is lost!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>“ON TO RICHMOND.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At mid-day, on the fifteenth of September, I took the train
at Fredericksburg for Richmond, expecting to make in three
hours the journey which our armies were more than as many
years in accomplishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On to Richmond! On to Richmond!” clattered the cars;
while my mind recalled the horrors and anxieties of those
years, so strangely in contrast with the swiftness and safety
of our present speed. Where now were the opposing Rebel
hosts? Where the long lines of bristling musketry, the swarms
of cavalry, and the terrible artillery? Where the great Slave
Empire, the defiant Confederacy itself?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The earth hath bubbles as the water has,</div>
      <div class='line'>And these were of them.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We passed amid the same desolate scenes which I had everywhere
observed since I set foot upon the soil of Virginia,—old
fields and undergrowths, with signs of human life so feeble
and so few, that one began to wonder where the country
population of the Old Dominion was to be found. All the
region between Fredericksburg and Richmond seems not only
almost uninhabited now, but always to have been so,—at
least to the eye familiar with New-England farms and villages.
But one must forget the thriving and energetic North
when he enters a country stamped with the dark seal of
slavery. Large and fertile Virginia, with eight times the
area of Massachusetts, scarcely equals in population that barren
little State. The result is, that, where Southern State pride
sees prosperous settlements, the travelling Yankee discovers
little more than uncultivated wastes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Ashton, sixteen miles from Richmond, was the first really
civilized-looking place we passed. Farther on I looked for
the suburbs of the capital. But Richmond has no suburbs.
The pleasant villages and market-gardens that spread smilingly
for miles around our large Northern towns, are altogether
wanting here. Suddenly the melancholy waste of the
country disappears, and you enter the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>And is this indeed Richmond into which the train glides so
smoothly along its polished rails? Is this the fort-encircled
capital whose gates refused so long to open to our loudly knocking
armies?—and have we entered with so little ado? Is the
“Rome of the Confederacy” sitting proudly on her seven
hills, aware that here are detestable Yankees within her walls?
Will she cast us into Libby? or starve us on Belle Island?
or forward us to Wirtz at Andersonville?—for such we know
was the fate of Northern men who <em>did</em> get into Richmond
during the past four years! You think of what <em>they</em> suffered,
as you walk unmolested the pavements of the conquered capital;
and something swells within you, which is not exultation,
nor rage, nor grief, but a strange mingling of all these.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Time the Avenger! unto thee I lift</div>
      <div class='line'>My hands and eyes and heart!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>for what a change has been wrought since those days of
horror and crime! Now no Rebel guard is at hand to march
you quickly and silently through the streets; but friendly
faces throng to welcome you, to offer you seats in carriages,
and to invite you to the hospitalities of hotels. And these
people, meeting or passing you, or seated before their doors
in the warm September afternoon, are no longer enemies,
but tamed complacent citizens of the United States like
yourself.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was surprised to find that the storm of war had left Richmond
so beautiful a city; although she appeared to be mourning
for her sins at the time in dust and ashes,—dust which
every wind whirled up from the unwatered streets, and the
ashes of the Burnt District.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Here are no such palatial residences as dazzle the eye in
New York, Chicago, and other Northern cities; but in their
place you see handsome rows of houses, mostly of brick, shaded
by trees, and with a certain air of comfort and elegance about
them which is very inviting. The streets are sufficiently spacious,
and regularly laid out, many of them being thrown up
into long, sweeping lines of beauty by the hills on which they
are built. The hills indeed are the charm of Richmond, overlooking
the falls of the James, on the left bank of which it
stands; giving you shining glimpses of the winding river up
and down,—commanding views of the verdant valley and
of the hilly country around,—and here, at the end of some
pleasant street, falling off abruptly into the wild slopes of
some romantic ravine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In size, Richmond strikes one as very insignificant, after all
the noise it has made in the world. Although the largest city
of Virginia, and ranking among Southern cities of the second
magnitude, either of our great Northern towns could swallow it,
as one pickerel swallows a lesser, and scarcely feel the morsel
in its belly. In 1860 it had a population of not quite thirty-eight
thousand,—less than that of Troy or New Haven, and
but a little larger than that of Lowell.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had already secured a not very satisfactory room at a
crowded hotel, when, going out for an afternoon ramble, I
came by chance to Capitol Square. Although a small park,
containing only about eight acres, I found in its shady walks
and by its twinkling fountains a delightful retirement after
the heat and dust of the streets. It is situated on the side
of a hill sloping down to the burnt district which lies between
it and the river. On the brow of the slope, at an imposing
elevation, its pillared front looking towards the western
sun, stands the State Capitol, which was also the capitol
of the Confederacy. Near by is Crawford’s equestrian statue
of Washington, which first astonishes the beholder by its vast
proportions, and does not soon cease to be a wonder to his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming out of the Park, at the corner nearest the monument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>I noticed, on the street-corner opposite, a hotel, whose
range of front rooms overlooking the square, made me think
ruefully of the lodgings I had engaged elsewhere. To exchange
a view of back yards and kitchen-roofs from an upper
story for a sight from those commanding windows, entered my
brain as an exciting possibility. I went in. The clerk had
two or three back rooms to show, but no front room, until he
saw that nothing else would suffice, when he obligingly sent
me to the very room I wished. Throwing open the shutters,
I looked out upon the Park, the Capitol, the colossal Washington
soaring above the trees, and the far-off shining James.
I caught glimpses, through the foliage, of the spray of one of
the fountains, and could hear its ceaseless murmur mingle
with the noise of the streets.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took possession at once, sent for my luggage, slept that
night in my new lodgings, and was awakened at dawn the
next morning by a sound as of a dish of beans dashed into
a ringing brass kettle. This was repeated at irregular intervals,
and with increasing frequency, as the day advanced,
breaking in upon the plashy monotone of the fountain, and the
rising hum of the city, with its resounding rattle. Stung with
curiosity, I arose and looked from my open window. Few
white citizens were astir, but I saw a thin, ceaseless stream
of negroes, who “would not work,” going cheerfully to their
daily tasks. The most of them took their way towards the
burnt district; some crossed Capitol Square to shorten their
route; and the sounds I had heard were occasioned by the
slamming of the iron gates of the Park.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BURNT DISTRICT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Again that morning I visited the burnt district, of which I
had taken but a cursory view the evening before.</p>

<p class='c000'>All up and down, as far as the eye could reach, the business
portion of the city bordering on the river lay in ruins. Beds
of cinders, cellars half filled with bricks and rubbish, broken
and blackened walls, impassable streets deluged with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span></i>,
here a granite front still standing, and there the iron fragments
of crushed machinery,—such was the scene which extended
over thirty entire squares and parts of other squares.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was reminded of Chambersburg; but here was ruin on a
more tremendous scale. Instead of small one- and two-story
buildings, like those of the modest Pennsylvania town, tall blocks,
great factories, flour-mills, rolling-mills, foundries, machine-shops,
warehouses, banks, railroad, freight, and engine houses,
two railroad bridges, and one other bridge spanning on high
piers the broad river, were destroyed by the desperate Rebel
leaders on the morning of the evacuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They meant to burn us all out of our homes,” said a citizen
whom I met on the butment of the Petersburg railroad bridge.
“It was the wickedest thing that ever was done in this world!
You are a stranger; you don’t know; but the people of Richmond
know, if they will only speak their minds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said I, “what was their object in burning their own
city, the city of their friends?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The devil only knows, for he set ’em on to do it! It was
spite, I reckon. If they couldn’t hold the city, they determined
nobody else should. They kept us here four years
under the worst tyranny under the sun; then when they
found they couldn’t keep us any longer, they just meant to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>burn us up. That’s the principle they went on from the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I had already conversed with other citizens on the subject
of the fire, some of whom maintained that it was never the
design of the Confederate leaders to burn anything but the
railroad bridges and public stores. But this man laughed at
the idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what they pretend; but I know better. What
was the water stopped from the reservoirs for? So that we
should have none to put out the fire with!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they say the water was shut off in order to make
repairs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all a lie! I tell ye, stranger, it was the intention to
burn Richmond, and it’s a miracle that any part of it was saved.
As luck would have it, there was no wind to spread the fire;
then the Federals came in, let on the water, and went to work
with the engines, and put it out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why didn’t the citizens do that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know. Everybody was paralyzed. It was a perfect
panic. The Yankees coming! the city burning! our army
on a retreat!—you’ve no idea of what it was. Nobody
seemed to know what to do. God save us from another such
time! It was bad enough Sunday. If the world had been
coming to an end, there couldn’t have been more fright and
confusion. I was watchman on this railroad bridge,—when
there was a bridge here. I was off duty at midnight, and I
went home and went to bed. But along towards morning my
daughter woke me. ‘Father,’ says she, ‘the city’s afire!’ I
knew right away what was the matter. The night was all lit
up, and I could hear the roar of something besides the river.
I run out and started for the bridge, but I’d got quite near
enough, when the ammunition in the tobacco-warehouses begun
to go off. Crack!—crack!—crack, crack, crack! One
piece of shell whirred past my head like a pa’tridge. I didn’t
want to hear another. I put home and went to getting my
truck together, such as I could tote, ready to leave if my house
went.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Subsequently I conversed with citizens of every grade upon
this exciting topic, and found opinions regarding it as various
as the political views of their authors. Those aristocrats who
went in for the war but kept out of the fight, and who favored
the Davis government because it favored them, had no word
of censure for the incendiaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The burning of the city was purely accidental,” one
blandly informed me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No considerable portion of it would have been destroyed
if it hadn’t been for private marauding parties,” said another.
“The city was full of such desperate characters. They set
fires for the purpose of plundering. It was they, and nobody
else, who shut off the water from the reservoirs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The laboring class, on the other hand, generally denounced
the Confederate leaders as the sole authors of the calamity. It
was true that desperadoes aided in the work, but it was after
the fugitive government had set them the example.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is the opinion of a Confederate officer, Colonel D——,
whom I saw daily at the table of the hotel, and with whom I
had many interesting conversations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not fair to lay the whole blame on the Confederate
government, although, Heaven knows, it was bad enough to
do anything! The plan of burning the city had been discussed
beforehand: Lee and the more humane of his officers opposed
it; Early and others favored it; and Breckinridge took the
responsibility of putting it into execution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Amid all these conflicting opinions there was one thing certain—the
fact of the fire; although, had it not been written
out there before our eyes in black characters and lines of desolation,
I should have expected to hear some unblushing apologist
of the Davis despotism deny even that.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, whoever may have been personally responsible for the
crime, there is also a truth concerning it which I hold to be
undeniable. Like the assassination of Lincoln, like the systematic
murder of Union prisoners at Andersonville and elsewhere,—like
these and countless other barbarous acts which
have branded the Rebel cause with infamy,—this too was inspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>by the spirit of slavery, and performed in the interest
of slavery. That spirit, destructive of liberty and law, and
self-destructive at last, was the father of the rebellion and of
all the worst crimes of its adherents. As I walked among the
ruins, pondering these thoughts, I must own that my heart
swelled with pride when I remembered how the fire was extinguished.
It was by no mere chance that the panic-stricken
inhabitants were found powerless to save their own city. That
task was reserved for the Union army, that a great truth might
be symbolized. The war, on the part of the North, was waged
neither for ambition nor revenge; its design was not destructive,
but conservative. Through all our cloudy mistakes and
misdeeds shone the spirit of Liberty; and the work she gave
us to do was to quench the national flames which anarchy had
kindled, and to save a rebellious people from the consequences
of their own folly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richmond had already one terrible reminiscence of a fire.
On the night of the 26th of December, 1811, its theatre was
burned, with an appalling catastrophe: upward of seventy
spectators, including the Governor of the State, perishing in the
flames. The fire of the 3d of April, 1865, will be as long
remembered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of rebuilding the burnt district had commenced,
and was progressing in places quite vigorously. Here I had
the satisfaction of seeing the negroes, who “would not work,”
actually at their tasks. Here, as everywhere else in Richmond,
and indeed in every part of Virginia I visited, colored
laborers were largely in the majority. They drove the teams,
made the mortar, carried the hods, excavated the old cellars or
dug new ones, and, sitting down amid the ruins, broke the
mortar from the old bricks and put them up in neat piles ready
for use. There were also colored masons and carpenters employed
on the new buildings. I could not see but that these
people worked just as industriously as the white laborers. And
yet, with this scene before our very eyes, I was once more informed
by a cynical citizen that the negro, now that he was
free, would rob, steal, or starve, before he would work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>I conversed with one of the laborers going home to his
dinner. He was a stalwart young black, twenty-one years old,
married, and the father of two children. He was earning a
dollar and a half a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you manage to live on that, and support your
family?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s right hard, these times,—everything costs so high.
I have to pay fifteen dollars a month rent, and only two little
rooms. But my wife takes in washing and goes out to work;
and so we get along.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said I, “were not your people better off in
slavery?”.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh no, sir!” he replied, with a bright smile. “We’re
a heap better off now. We haven’t got our rights yet, but I
expect we’re go’n’ to have ’em soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What rights?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know, sir. But I reckon government will do something
for us. My master has had me ever since I was seven
years old, and never give me nothing. I worked for him
twelve years, and I think something is due me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was waiting to see what the government would do for
his people. He rather expected the lands of their Rebel masters
would be given them, insisting that they ought to have some
reward for all their years of unrequited toil. Of course I
endeavored to dissuade him from cherishing any such hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What you ask for may be nothing but justice; but we
must not expect justice even in this world. We must be thankful
for what we can get. You have your freedom, and you
ought to consider yourself lucky.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His features shone with satisfaction as he replied,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“That ought to be enough, if we don’t get no mo’e. We’re
men now, but when our masters had us we was only change
in their pockets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Unlike what I saw in Chambersburg, the new blocks springing
up in the burnt district did not promise to be an improvement
on the old ones. Everywhere were visible the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of want of capital and of the hurry of rebuilding. The thinness
of the walls was alarming; and I was not surprised to
learn that some of them had recently been blown down on a
windy night. Heaven save our country, thought I, from such
hasty and imperfect reconstruction!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>LIBBY, CASTLE THUNDER, AND BELLE ISLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Strolling along a street near the river, below the burnt
district, I looked up from the dirty pavements, and from the
little ink-colored stream creeping along the gutter, (for Richmond
abounds in these villanous rills,) and saw before me a
sign nailed to the corner of a large, gloomy brick building,
and bearing in great black letters the inscription,—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LIBBY PRISON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Passing the sentinel at the door, I entered. The ground-floor
was partitioned off into offices and store-rooms, and presented
few objects of interest. A large cellar room below,
paved with cobble-stones, was used as a cookhouse by our
soldiers then occupying the building. Adjoining this, but
separated from it by a wall, was the cellar which is said to
have been mined for the purpose of blowing up Libby with
its inmates, in case the city had at one time been taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ascending a flight of stairs from the ground-floor, I found
myself in a single, large, oblong, whitewashed, barren room.
Two rows of stout wooden posts supported the ceiling. The
windows were iron-grated, those of the front looking out upon
the street, and those of the rear commanding a view of the
canal close by, the river just beyond it, and the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an immense garret above, likewise embracing
the entire area of the floor. These were the prison-rooms of
the infamous Libby. I found them occupied by a regiment
of colored troops, some sitting in Turkish fashion on the floor,
(for there was not a stool or bench,) some resting their backs
against the posts or whitewashed walls, and others lying at
length on the hard planks, with their heads pillowed on their
knapsacks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>But the comfortable colored regiment faded from sight as
I ascended and descended the stairs, and walked from end to
end of the dreary chambers. A far different picture rose
before me,—the diseased and haggard men crowded together
there, dragging out their weary days, deeming themselves
oftentimes forgotten by their country and their friends,—men
who mounted those dungeon-stairs, not as I mounted
them, but to enter a den of misery, starvation, and death.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the opposite side of the same street, a little farther up,
was Castle Thunder,—a very commonplace brick block, considering
its formidable name. It was still used as a prison;
but it had passed into the hands of the United States military
authorities. At the iron-barred windows of the lower story,
and behind tin wooden-barred windows above, could be
seen the faces of soldiers and citizens imprisoned for various
offences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Belle Island I had already seen from the heights of Richmond,—a
pleasant hill rising out of the river above the town,
near the farther shore. The river itself is very beautiful there,
with its many green islets, its tumbling rapids sweeping down
among rocks and foaming over ledges, and its side-dams thrown
out like arms to draw the waters into their tranquil embrace.
My eye, ranging over this scene, rested on that fair hill; and
I thought that, surely, no pleasanter or more healthful spot
could have been selected for an encampment of prisoners;
But it is unsafe to trust the enchantment of distance; and
after seeing Libby and Castle Thunder, I set out to visit Belle
Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>I crossed over to Manchester by a bridge which had been
constructed since the fire. As both the Richmond and Danville,
and the Richmond and Petersburg railroad bridges were
destroyed, an extraordinary amount of business and travel
was thrown upon this bridge. It was shaken with omnibuses
and freight-wagons, and enveloped in clouds of dust. Loads
of cotton and tobacco, the former in bales, the latter in hogsheads,
were coming into the city, and throngs of pedestrians
were passing to and fro. Among these I noticed a number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of negroes with little bundles on their backs. One of them,
a very old man, was leaning against the railing to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, uncle, how are you getting along?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tolerable, mahster; only tolerable.” And he lifted his
tattered cap from his white old head with a grace of politeness
which a courtier might have envied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’s go’n’ to Richmond, mahster.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you expect to do in Richmond?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know right well. I thought I couldn’t be no wus
off than whar I was; and I hadn’t no place to go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How so, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, mahster, thar a’n’t no chance fo’ people o’ my
color in the country I come from.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dinwiddie County.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have walked all the way from Dinwiddie County?”
“Yes, mahster; I’se walked over fo’ty mile. But I don’t
mind that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re very old, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I’ve a right good age, mahster. It’s hard fo’ a man
o’ my years to be turned out of his home. I don’t know
what I shall do; but I reckon the Lord will take keer of me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tone of patience and cheerfulness in which he spoke
was very touching. I leaned on the bridge beside him, and
drew out from him by degrees his story. His late master
refused to give wages to the freedmen on his lands, and the
result was that all the able-bodied men and women left him.
Enraged at this, he had sworn that the rest should go too, and
had accordingly driven off the aged and the sick, this old man
among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said he’d no use fo’ old wore-out niggers. I knowed
I was old and wore-out, but I growed so in his service. I
served him and his father befo’e nigh on to sixty year; and he
never give me a dollar. He’s had my life, and now I’m old
and wore-out I must leave. It’s right hard, mahster!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not all the planters in your county are like him, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Some of ’em is very good to their people, I believe. But
none of ’em is will’n’ to pay wages a man can live by. Them
that pays at all, offers only five dollars a month, and we must
pay fo’ ou’ own clothes and doctor’s bills, and suppo’t ou’ families.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems you were better off when in slavery,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t say that, mahster. I’d sooner be as I is to-day.”
And cheerfully shouldering his bundle, the old African
tramped on towards Richmond. What was to become of him
there?</p>

<p class='c000'>I kept on to Manchester, passed the great humming mills by
the river-side, and turning to the right, up the Danville railroad,
reached Belle Island bridge after a brisk fifteen minutes’
walk. Crossing over, I entered the yard of a nail-factory,
where some men were breaking up heavy old iron, cannons,
mortars, and car-wheels, by means of a four-hundred pound
shot dropped from a derrick forty feet high. Beyond the factory
rose the pleasant hill I had viewed from the city. I
climbed its southern side, and found myself in the midst of a
scene not less fair than I had anticipated. Behind me was a
cornfield, covering the summit; below rushed the river among
its green and rocky islands; while Richmond rose beyond, picturesquely
beautiful on its hills, and rosy in the flush of sunset.</p>

<p class='c000'>But where had been the prisoners’ camp? I saw no trace
of it on that slope. Alas, that slope was never trodden by their
feet, and its air they never breathed. At the foot of it is a
flat, spreading out into the stream, and almost level with it at
high water. Already the night-fog was beginning to creep
over it. This flat, which was described to me as a marsh in
the rainy season, and covered with snow and slush and ice in
winter, was the “Belle Isle” of our prisoners. Yet they
were not allowed the range even of that. A trench and embankment
enclosing an oblong space of less than six acres
formed the dead-line which it was fatal to pass. Within this
as many as twelve thousand men were at times crowded, with
no shelter but a few tattered tents.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was examining the spot, a throng of begrimed laborers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>crossed the flat, carrying oars, and embarking in boats on the
low shore looking towards the city. They were workmen
from the nail-factory returning to their homes. One of them,
passing alone after his companions, stopped to talk with me at
the dead-line, and afterwards offered me a place in his boat.
It was a leaky little skiff: I perched myself upon a seat in the
bow; and he, standing in the stern, propelled it across with a
pole.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where were the dead buried?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The dead Yankees? They buried a good many thar in
the sand-bar. But they might about as well have flung ’em
into the river. A freshet washed out a hundred and twenty
bodies at one time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you see the prisoners when they were here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wasn’t on the Island. But from Richmond anybody
could see their tents hyer, and see them walking around. I
was away most of the time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the army?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir; I was in the army. I enlisted fo’ three months,
and they kept me in fou’ years,” he said, as men speak of deep
and unforgiven wrongs. “The wa’ was the cruelest thing, and
the wust thing fo’ the South that could have been. What do
you think they’ll do with Jeff Davis?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” I replied; “what do you think?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know what I’d like to do with him: I’d hang him as
quick as I would a mad dog! Him and about fo’ty others:
old Buchanan along with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, what has Buchanan done?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was in cohoot with ’em, and as bad as the baddest.
If we had had an honest President in his place, thar never’d
have been wa’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From the day I entered Virginia it was a matter of continual
astonishment to me to hear the common people express
views similar to those, and denounce the Davis despotism.
They were all the more bitter against it because it had deceived
them with lies and false promises so long. Throughout the
loyal North, the feeling against the secession leaders was naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>strong; but it was mild as candle-light compared with the
fierce furnace-heat of hatred which I found kindled in many a
Southern breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>The passage of the river was delightful, in the fading sunset
light. On a bluff opposite Belle Island was Hollywood, the
fashionable cemetery of Richmond, green-wooded, and beautiful
at that hour in its cool and tranquil tints. As we glided
down the river, and I took my last view of the Island, I
thought how often our sick and weary soldiers there must have
cast longing eyes across at that lovely hill, and wished themselves
quietly laid away in its still shades. Nor could I help
thinking of the good people of Richmond, the Christian citizens
of Richmond, taking their pleasant walks and drives to that
verdant height, and looking down on the camp of prisoners
dying from exposure and starvation under their very eyes.
How did these good people, these Christian citizens, feel about
it, I wonder?</p>

<p class='c000'>Avoiding the currents sweeping towards the Falls, my man
pushed into the smooth waters of a dam that fed a race, and
landed me close under the walls of his own house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This yer is Brown’s Island,” he told me. “You’ve heerd
of the laboratory, whar they made ammunition fo’ the army?”
He showed me the deserted buildings, and described an explosion
which took place there, blowing up the works, and killing,
scalding, and maiming many of the operatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing over a bridge to the main land, and crossing the canal
which winds along the river-bank, I was hastening towards the
city, when I met, emerging from the sombre ruins of the burnt
district, a man who resembled more a wild creature than a
human being. His hands, arms, and face were blackened with
cinders, his clothes hung upon him in tatters, and the expression
of his countenance was fierce and haggard. He looked so
much like a brigand that I was not a little startled when, with
a sweeping gesture of his long lean arm and claw-like fingers,
he clutched my shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come back with me,” said he, “and I’ll tell ye all about
it; I’ll tell ye all about it, stranger.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The explosion,—the explosion of the laboratory thar!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dragging me towards Brown’s Island with one hand, and
gesticulating violently with the other, he proceeded to jabber
incoherently about that dire event.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait, wait,” said he, “till I tell you!”—like the Ancient
Mariner with skinny hand holding his unwilling auditor.
“My daughter was work’n’ thar at the time; and she was
blowed all to pieces! all to pieces! My God, my God, it was
horrible! Come to my house, and you shall see her; if you
don’t believe me, you shall see her! Blowed all to pieces, all
to pieces, my God!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His house was close by, and the daughter, who was “blowed
all to pieces,” was to be seen standing miraculously at the door,
in a remarkable state of preservation, considering the circumstances.
She seemed to be looking anxiously at the old man
and the stranger he was bringing home with him. She came
to the wicket to meet us; and then I saw that her hands and
face were covered with cruel scars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look!” said he, clutching her with one hand, while he
still held me with the other. “All to pieces, as I told you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t, don’t, pa!” said the girl, coaxingly. “You mustn’t
mind him,” she whispered to me. “He is a little out of
his head. Oh, pa! don’t act so!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has been telling me how you were blown up in the
laboratory. You must have suffered fearfully from those
Wounds!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes; there was five weeks nobody thought I would
live. But I didn’t mind it,” she added with a smile, “for it
was in a good cause.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A good cause!” almost shrieked the old man; and he
burst forth with a stream of execrations against the Confederate
government which made my blood chill.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the daughter smilingly repeated, “It was a good cause,
and I don’t regret it. You mustn’t mind what he says.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I helped her get him inside the wicket, and made my escape,
wondering, as I left them, which was the more insane of the
two.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>But she was not insane; she was a woman. A man may
be reasoned and beaten out of a false opinion, but a woman
never. She will not yield to logic, not even to the logic of
events. Thus it happens that, while the male secessionists at
the South have frankly given up their cause, the female secessionists
still cling to it with provoking tenacity. To appeal to
their intelligence is idle; but they are vulnerable on the side
of the sentiments; and many a one has been authentically converted
from the heresy of state rights by some handsome
Federal officer, who judiciously mingled love with loyalty in
his speech, and pleaded for the union of hands as well as the
union of States.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>FEEDING THE DESTITUTE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As I was passing Castle Thunder, I observed, besieging
the doors of the United States Commissary, on the opposite
side of the street, a hungry-looking, haggard crowd,—sickly-faced
women, jaundiced old men, and children in rags; with
here and there a seedy gentleman who had seen better days,
or a stately female in faded apparel, which, like her refined
manners, betrayed the aristocratic lady whom the war had
reduced to want.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were the destitute of the city, thronging to receive
alms from the government. The regular rations, issued at
a counter to which each was admitted in his or her turn,
consisted of salt-fish and hard-tack; but I noticed that to
some tea and sugar were dealt out. All were provided with
tickets previously issued to them by the Relief Commission.
One tall, sallow woman requested me to read her ticket, and
tell her if it was a “No. 2.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They telled me it was, whar I got it, but I like to be
shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I assured her that it was truly a “No. 2,” and asked why
it was preferable to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the kind they ishy to sick folks; it allows tea and
sugar,” she replied, wrapping it around her skinny finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colored people were not permitted to draw “destitute rations”
for themselves at the same place with the whites.
There were a good many colored servants in the crowd,
however, drawing for their mistresses, who remained at
home, too ill or too proud to come in person and present their
tickets.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>At the place where “destitute rations” were issued to the
blacks, business appeared very dull. I inquired the reason
of it, and learned this astonishing fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colored population crowded into Richmond at that time
equalled the white population; being estimated by some as
high as twenty-five thousand. Of the whites, over TWO
THOUSAND were at that time receiving support from the government.
The number of blacks receiving such support was
less than two hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>How is this discrepancy to be accounted for?</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the freedmen’s willingness to work under right conditions
there can be no question. It is true, they do not show
a disposition to continue to serve their former masters for
nothing, or at starvation prices. And many of them had a
notion that lands were to be given them; for lands had been
promised them. At the same time, where they have a show of
a chance for themselves, they generally go to work, and manifest
a commendable pride in supporting themselves and their
families. Until he does that, the negro does not consider that
he is fully free. He has no prejudice against labor, as so many
of the whites have. We must give slavery the credit of
having done thus much for him: it has bred him up to habits
of temperance and industry. Notwithstanding the example
of the superior race, which he naturally emulates, he has not
yet taken to drink; and his industry, instead of being checked,
has received an impulse by emancipation. Now that he has
inducements to exert himself, he proceeds to his task with an
alacrity which he never showed when driven to it by the
whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another thing must be taken into account. His feeling
for those who have liberated him is that of unbounded gratitude.
He is ashamed to ask alms of the government which
has already done so much for him. No case was known in
Richmond of his obtaining destitute rations under false pretences;
but in many instances, as I learned, he had preferred
to suffer want rather than apply for aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reverse of all this may be said of a large class of whites.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Many, despising labor, would not work if they could. Others,
reared amid the influences of wealth, which had now been
stripped from them, could not work if they would. Towards
the United States Government they entertained no such feeling
of gratitude as animated the freedmen. On the contrary,
they seemed to think that they were entitled to support from
it during the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You ought to do something for us, for you’ve took away
our niggers,” whined a well-dressed woman one day in my
hearing. To the force of the objection, that the South owed
the loss of its slaves to its own folly, she appeared singularly
insensible; and she showed marked resentment because nothing
was done for her, although obliged to confess that she
owned the house she lived in, and another for which two colored
families were paying rent.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was sitting in one of the tents of the Relief Commission
one morning, when a woman came to complain that a ticket
issued to her there had drawn but fifteen rations, instead of
twenty-one, as she had expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I didn’t think it was you all’s fault,” she said, with an
apologetic grimace; “but I knowed I’d been powerfully
cheated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the spirit manifested by very many, both of the
rich and the poor. They felt that they had a sacred right to
prey upon the government, and any curtailment of that privilege
they regarded as a wrong and a fraud. So notorious was
their rapacity, that they were satirically represented as saying
to the government,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have done our best to break you up, and now we are
doing our best to eat you up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Where such a spirit existed, it was not possible to prevent
hundreds from obtaining government aid who were not entitled
to it. It was the design of the Relief Commission to feed
only indigent women and children. No rations were issued by
the Commissary except to those presenting tickets; and tickets
were issued for the benefit only of those whose destitute condition
was attested by certificates signed by a clergyman or physician.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>To secure these certificates, however, was not difficult,
even for those who stood in no need of government
charity. Clergymen and physicians were not all honest.
Many of them believed with the people that the government
was a fit object for good secessionists to prey upon. Some
were faithful in the performance of their duty; but if one
physician refused to sign a false statement, it was easy to dismiss
him, and call in another less scrupulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have just exposed two spurious cases of destitution,”
said an officer of the Relief Commission, one day as I entered
his tent. “Mrs. A——, on Fourth Street, has been
doing a thriving business all summer, by selling the rations
she has drawn for a fictitious family. Mrs. B—— has been
getting support for herself, and two sick daughters, that turn
out to be two great lazy sons, who take her hard-tack and salt-fish,
and exchange them for whiskey, get drunk every night,
and lie abed till noon every day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you do with such cases?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cut them off; that is all we can do. This whole business
of feeding the poor of Richmond,” he added, “is a humbug.
Richmond is a wealthy city still; it is very well able to take
care of its own poor, and should be taxed for the purpose.”
I found this to be the opinion of many intelligent unbiased
observers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the Relief Commission, and the Freedmen’s Commission,
both maintained by the government, I found an
agency of the American Union Commission established in
Richmond. This Commission, supported by private benevolence,
was organized for the purpose of aiding the people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the South, “in the restoration of their civil and social condition,
upon the basis of industry, education, freedom, and
Christian morality.” In Richmond, it was doing a useful
work. To the small farmers about the city it issued ploughs,
spades, shovels, and other much needed implements,—for
the war had beaten pitchforks into bayonets, and cast ploughshares
into cannon. Earlier in the season it had distributed
many thousand papers of garden-seeds to applicants from all
parts of the State,—a still greater benefit to the impoverished
people, with whom it was a common saying, that “good seed
ran out under the Confederacy.” It had established a free
school for poor whites. I also found Mr. C. the Commission’s
Richmond agent, indefatigable in assisting other associations in
the establishment of schools for the Freedmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Union Commission performed likewise an indispensable
part in feeding the poor. Those clergymen and physicians
who were so prompt to grant certificates to secessionists not
entitled to them, were equally prompt to refuse them to persons
known as entertaining Union sentiments. To the few
genuine Union people of Richmond, therefore, the Commission
came, and was welcomed as an angel of mercy. But it
did not confine its favors to them; having divided the city
into twelve districts, and appointed inspectors for each, it extended
its aid to such of the needy as the Relief Commission
had been unable to reach.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNION MEN OF RICHMOND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At the tent of the Union Commission, pitched near a fountain
on Capitol Square, I met a quiet little man in laborer’s
clothes, whom the agent introduced to me as “Mr. H——,”
adding, “There were two votes cast against the ordinance
of secession in this city: one of those votes was cast by Mr.
H——. He is one of the twenty-one Union men of Richmond.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked to be near fifty years of age; but he told me
he was only thirty-two. “I’ve been through such things as
make a man look old!” He showed me his gray hair, which
he said was raven black, without a silver streak, before the
war.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was four times taken to the conscript camp, but never
sent off to fight. I worked in a foundery, and my employer got
out exemption papers for me. The Confederates, when they
wanted more men, would declare any time that all the exemption
papers then out were void, and go to picking us up in the
street and sending us off to camp before we knew it. Some
would buy themselves off, and a few would get off as I did,—because
they could do work nobody else could do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a man of intuitive ideas and originality of character.
Although bred up under the influence of the peculiar
institution, poor, and uneducated, he had early formed clear
and strong convictions on the subject of slavery. “I was an
Abolitionist before I ever heard the word abolitionist.” He
believed in true religion, but not in the religion of traitors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never hesitated to tell ’em what I thought. ‘God has
no more to do with you all,’ says I, ‘than he has with last
year’s rain. I’d as lieves go to a gambling-house, as to go and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>hear a minister pray that God would drive back the armies of
the North. You are on your knees mocking at God, and He
laughs at you!’ Events proved that what I said was true.
After every Fast, the Rebels lost some important point. There
was a Fast-day just before Fort Donelson; another before New
Orleans was taken; another before Gettysburg and Vicksburg;
another before Atlanta fell; and another before the
evacuation of Richmond. That was the way God answered
their prayers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He corroborated the worst accounts I had heard concerning
the state of society in Richmond during the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seemed as though there was nothing but thieving and
robbery going on. The worst robbers were Hood’s men, set
to guard the city. They’d halt a man, and shoot him right
down if he wouldn’t stop. They’d ask a man the time,
and snatch his watch. They went to steal some chickens of
a man I knew, and as he tried to prevent them, they killed
him. At last the women got to stealing. We had an insurrection
of women here, you know. I never saw such a sight.
They looked like flocks of old buzzards, picked geese, and
cranes; dressed in all sorts of odd rigs; armed with hatchets,
knives, axes,—anything they could lay their hands on. They
collected together on the Square, and Governor Letcher made
’em a speech from the Monument. They hooted at him.
Then Jeff Davis made a speech; they hooted at him too;
they didn’t want speeches, they said; they wanted bread.
Then they begun to plunder the stores. They’d just go in
and carry off what they pleased. I saw three women put a
bag of potatoes, and a barrel of flour, and a firkin of butter in
a dray; then they ordered the darkey to drive off, with two
women for a guard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of the faithful twenty-one was Mr. L——, whom
I found at a restaurant kept by him near the old market. It
was he who carried off Col. Dahlgren’s body, after it had been
buried by the Rebels at Oak Wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I found a negro who knew the spot, and hired him to go
with me one dark night, and dig up the body. We carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>it to Mr. Rowlett’s house [Mr. Rowlett was another of the
faithful], and afterwards took it through the Confederate lines,
in broad daylight, hid under a load of peach-trees, and
buried it in a metallic case. It lay there until after the
evacuation, when it was dug up and sent home to Admiral
Dahlgren’s family.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. L—— devoted much of his time and means during
the war to feeding Union prisoners, and helping Union men
through the lines. “I was usually at work that way all
night; so the next day I’d be looking sick and sleepy; and
that way,—with a little money to bribe the doctors,—I
kept out of the Rebel army.” In January, 1865, he was
arrested for sending information through the lines to General
Butler, and lay in prison until the evacuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most interesting evenings in my Richmond
experience I passed at the house of Mr. W——, on Twenty-fifth
Street. A Northern man by birth and education, he had
remained true to his nativity at a time when so many from
the Free States living at the South had proved renegades and
apostates. Arrested early in the war for “disloyalty,” he had
suffered six months in Salisbury Prison because he would
not take the oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could have got my liberty any day by taking that oath.
But I never would, and never did. As good and true men
as ever trod the earth died there because they would not
take it. Mr. Buck, of Kentucky, was one. Almost his
last words were, ‘Tell my wife I would be glad to go home,
but I’d rather die here than take an oath that will perjure
my soul.’ He was happy; he died. Dying was not the
worst part of it, by any means; our sufferings every day
were worse than death.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Liberated at last, through the intercession of his wife, Mr.
W—— came home, and devoted himself to feeding and rescuing
Union prisoners, and to serving his country in other
perilous ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>He corroborated what had been told me with regard to
the number of Union men in Richmond.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“You will find men enough now, who claim to have been
Union men from the first. But of those whose loyalty stood
the test of persecution in every shape, there are just twenty-one,—no
more, and no less. I’ve watched them all through,
and if there’s a Union man I don’t know, I should like to see
him. Those men of influence, who opposed secession in the
beginning, and afterwards voted for it, but who pretend now
to have been in favor of the Union all the while, were the
most mischievous traitors of all, for they carried the lukewarm
with them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were Union women, however, who worked and suffered
as heroically for the cause as the men. “One lady was
nine months in prison here for sending information through
the lines to our armies. She was very ill at one time, and
wished to see a minister. They sent her Jeff Davis’s minister.
‘Miserable wretch!’ said he, ‘I suppose I must pray
with you, but I don’t see how I can!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When my husband was in prison,” said Mrs. W——,
“we suffered greatly for the necessaries of life. We had a
little money in the savings-bank; and he sent us an order for
it: ‘Please pay to my little son,’ and so forth. Payment
was refused, because he had not taken the oath of allegiance,
and the money was confiscated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the labors, perils, sacrifices, and anxieties which the
Union men of Richmond underwent, in giving secret aid
to the good cause, no adequate account has ever been published,
nor ever will be published. “I did no other business
at the time. I gave my whole life to it, and all my means.
I nearly went crazy. Besides Libby and Castle Thunder,
there were several smaller prisons in Richmond. There was
one next door to us here. There was another on the opposite
side, a little farther up the street. We had the prisoners
under our very eyes, and couldn’t help doing something for
them. We could see their haggard faces and imploring eyes
looking out at us from the windows,—or from behind the windows,—for
it wasn’t safe for them to come too near. One
day I saw one approach a little nearer than usual,—his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>was perhaps a foot from the window,—when the guard deliberately
put up his gun and blew out his brains. He was
immediately carried away in a cart; and as a little red stream
trickled along the ground, a boy ran after it, shouting, ‘Thar’s
some Yankee blood; bring a cup and ketch it!’ The papers
next day boasted that in an hour the dead man was under the
sod.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A fund was secretly collected for the benefit of the prisoners.
One of the first contributors towards it was an illiterate poor
man named White. He put in five dollars. Mr. W—— told
him that was too much for a man in his circumstances. “No,”
said White, “I’s got two fives, and I reckon the least I can
do is to go halves.” From that small beginning the fund
grew to the handsome sum of thirteen thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>White, concealing his Union sentiments from the authorities,
got permission to sell milk and other things to the prisoners,
which they paid for often with money he smuggled in
to them. With small bribes he managed to secure the good-will
of the guard. He played his part admirably, higgling
with his customers, and complaining of hard times and small
profits, while he gave them milk and money, and carried
letters for them. One day a prisoner was observed to slip
something into his can. To divert suspicion, White pretended
great surprise, and, appearing to fish out a dime, held it up to
the light as if to assure himself that it was real. “I’s durned
if there a’n’t one honest Yankee!” said he, with a grin of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. W—— obtained permission to send some books to the
prisoners; very few reached them, however,—the greater
part being appropriated by the Rebels. Donations of clothing
and other necessaries met with a similar fate. In this state
of things, White’s ancient mule-cart and honest face proved
invaluable. He carried a pass-book, in which exchanged prisoners
were credited with sums subscribed for the benefit of
their late companions. Many of these subscriptions were
purely fictitious,—the money coming from the Union-men’s
fund. On the strength of one fabulous contribution, set down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>at fifty dollars, he had given the prisoners over a hundred dollars’
worth of provisions, when a Rebel surgeon stopped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Haven’t you paid up that everlasting fifty dollars yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Doctor,” said White, producing his pass-book, “I’s an
honest man, I is; and if you say I can’t put in no more on
this yer score, you jest write your name hyer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The surgeon declining to assume the responsibility, White
managed to take in to the prisoners, on the same imaginary
account, milk and eggs to the amount of fifty dollars more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I told you there were only twenty-one Union men in Richmond,”
said Mr. W——. “I meant <em>white</em> Union men. Some
of the colored people were as ready to give their means and
risk their lives for the cause as anybody. One poor negro
woman, who did washing for Confederate officers, spent her
earnings to buy flour and bake bread, which she got in to the
prisoners through a hole under the jail-yard fence; knowing
all the while she’d be shot, if caught at it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. W—— assisted over twenty Union prisoners to escape.
Among other adventures, he related to me the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“From our windows we could look right over into the
prison-yard adjoining us here. Every day we could see the
dead carried out. In the evening they carried out those who
had died since morning, and every morning they carried out
those that had died over night. Once we counted seventeen
dead men lying together in the yard, all stripped of their
clothes, ready for burial; so terrible was the mortality in
these prisons. The dead-house was in a corner of the yard.
A negro woman occupied another house outside of the guard-line,
and close to my garden fence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took me to visit the premises. We entered by a heavy
wooden gate from the street, and stood within the silent
enclosure. It was a clear, beautiful evening, and the moonlight
lay white and peaceful upon the gable of the warehouse
that had served as a prison, upon the old buildings
and fences, and upon the ground the weary feet of the sick
prisoners had trodden, and where the outstretched corpses
had lain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Every day some of the prisoners would be marched down
to the medical department, a few blocks below, to be examined.
A colored girl who lived with us, used to go out with bread
hid under her apron, and slip it into their hands, if she had
a chance, as she met them coming back. One morning she
brought home a note, which one of them, Capt. ——, had
given her. It was a letter of thanks ‘to his unknown benefactors.’
Miss H——, who was visiting us at the time, proposed
to answer it. It was much less dangerous for her to do
so, than it would have been for me, for I was a suspected
man; I had already been six months in a Rebel prison. But
if she was discovered writing to a Yankee, her family would
be prepared to express great surprise and indignation at the
circumstance, and denounce it as a ‘love affair.’” (The
H——s are one of the Union families of Richmond; and Miss
H—— was a young girl of nerve and spirit.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“In this way we got into communication with the Captain.
It wasn’t long, of course, before he made proposals to Miss
H——; not of the usual sort, however, but of a kind we
expected. He and another of the prisoners, a surgeon, had
resolved to attempt an escape, and they wanted our assistance.
After several notes on the subject had passed,—some
through the hands of the colored girl, some through a crack
in the fence,—everything was arranged for a certain evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Citizens’ clothes were all ready for them; and I obtained a
promise from G——, a good Union man, to conceal them in
his house until they could be got away. To avoid the very
thing that happened, he was not to tell his wife; but she suspected
mischief,—for it’s hard for a man to hide what he
feels, when he knows his life is at stake,—and she gave him
no peace until he let her into the secret. She declared that
the men should never be brought into their house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’We’ve just got shet of one boarder,’ says she, meaning
a prisoner they had harbored, ‘and I never’ll have another.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“I couldn’t blame her much; for we were trifling with our
lives. But G—— felt terribly about it. He came down to let
me know. It was the very evening the men were to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>out, and too late to get word to them. If their plans succeeded,
they would be sure to come out; and what was to be done
with them? They would not be safe with me an hour. My
house would be the first one searched. G—— went off, for
he could do nothing. Then, as it grew dark, we were expecting
them every moment. There was nobody here but
Miss H——, my wife, and myself. The colored girl was in
the kitchen. It was dangerous to make any unusual movements,
for the Rebel guard in the street was marching past
every three minutes, and looking in. We sat quietly talking
on indifferent subjects, with such sensations inside as nobody
knows anything about who hasn’t been through such a scene.
My clothes were wet through with perspiration. Every time
after the guard had passed, we held our breath, until—tramp,
tramp!—he came round again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At last in came the colored girl, rushing from the kitchen,
in great fright, and gasped out in a hoarse whisper,—‘Lord
Jesus, master! two Yankees done come right into our backyard!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’We have nothing to do with the Yankees,’ I said; ‘go
about your work, and let ’em alone.’ And still we sat there,
and talked, or pretended to read, while once more—tramp,
tramp, tramp—the guard marched by the windows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But there was a guard inside the prison-yard; how then
had the Yankees managed to get out?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m coming to that now. I told you the dead were
borne out every morning and evening. That evening there
was an extra body. It was the Yankee Doctor. He had
bribed the prisoners, who carried out the dead, to carry him
out. The dead-house was outside of the guard. They laid
him with the corpses, and returned to the prison. Poor fellows!
there were four of them; they were sent to Andersonville
for their share in the transaction, and there every one of
them died.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A little while after, as some prisoners were going in from
the yard, they got into a fight near the door. The guard
ran to interfere; and the Captain, who was waiting for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>very chance,—for the scuffle was got up by his friends expressly
for his benefit,—darted into the negro woman’s house,
and ran up-stairs. From a window he jumped down into my
garden. In the mean time the Doctor came to life, crawled out
from among the dead men, pushed a board from the back side
of the dead house, climbed the fence, and joined his friend
the Captain, under our kitchen windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a move was made by any of us. We kept on chatting,
yawning, or pretending to read the newspaper; and all
the while the guard in the street was going his rounds and
peeping in. Everything—the freedom of these men, and
my life—was hanging by a cobweb. One mistake, a single
false step, would ruin us. But everything had been preärranged.
They found the clothes ready for them, and we were
waiting only to give them time to disguise themselves. So
far, it could not be proved that I had anything to do with the
business, but the time was coming for me to take it into my
own hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I showed you the alley running from the street to my
backyard, and now you’ll see why I took you around there.
The Captain and the Doctor after getting on their disguise,
were to keep watch by the corner of the house at the end of
the alley, and wait for the signal,—a gentleman going out of
the house with a lady on his arm and a white handkerchief in
his hand. They were to come out of the alley immediately,
and follow at a respectful distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Having given them plenty of time,—not very many minutes,
however, though they seemed hours to us,—Miss H——
put on her bonnet, and I took my hat; I watched my opportunity,
and just as the guard had passed, gave her my arm, and set
out to escort her home. As we went out, I had occasion to
use my handkerchief, which I flirted, and put back into my
pocket. We didn’t look behind us once, but walked on,
never knowing whether our men were following or not, until,
after we had passed several corners, Miss H—— ventured to
peep over her shoulder. Sure enough, there were two men
coming along after us.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“We walked past Jeff Davis’s house, and stopped at her
father’s door. There I took leave of her, and walked on
alone. I had made up my mind what to do. G—— having
failed us, I must try R——; an odd old man, but true as
steel. It was a long walk to his house, and it was late when
I got there. I hid my men in a barn, and knocked at the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Anything the matter?’ says Mrs. R——, from the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I want to speak with Mr. R—— a moment,’ I said.
I saw she was frightened, when she found out who I was;
but she made haste to let me in. Serious as my business
was, I couldn’t help laughing when I found R——. He
sleeps on a mattress, his wife sleeps on feathers; and both,
occupy the same bed. They compromise their difference of
taste in this way: they double up the feather-bed for Mrs.
R——; that gives her a double portion, and makes room for
R—— on the mattress. She sleeps on a mountain in the
foreground; he, in the valley behind her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’W——,’ says he, looking up over the mountain, ‘there’s
mischief ahead! You wouldn’t be coming here at this hour
if there wasn’t. Is it a Castle Thunder case?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’No,’ I said, quietly as I could, for he was very much
agitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I’m afraid of Castle Thunder!’ says he. ‘I’m afraid
of you! If it isn’t a Castle Thunder case, I demand to
know what it is.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’It’s a halter case,’ I said. And then I told him. He
got up and pulled on his clothes. I took out fifty dollars in
Rebel money, and offered him, for the feeding of the men till
they could be got away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You can’t get any of that stuff on to me!’ says he.
‘I’m afraid of it. We shall all lose our lives, this time, I’m
sure. Why did you bring ’em here?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“But though fully convinced he was to die for it, he finally
consented to take in the fugitives. So I delivered them into
his hands; but my work didn’t end there. They were nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>days at his house. Meantime, through secret sources, by
means of bribes, I got passes to take them through the lines.
These cost me a hundred dollars in greenbacks; then, when
everything was ready, all passes were revoked, and they were
good for nothing. Finally Dennis Shane took the job of running
them through the lines for five hundred dollars in Rebel
money.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He got them safely through; and just a month from that
time one of those men came back for me. General Butler sent
him: he wanted to talk with me about affairs in Richmond.
I went out with a party of seven; and when near Williamsburg
we were all captured by a band of Confederate soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I determined not to be taken back to Richmond and
identified, if I could help it. I got down at a spring to drink,
crawled along under the bank a little way, as fast as I could,
then jumped up, and ran for my life. I was shot at, and
chased; they put dogs on my track; I was four days and
nights without food; but I escaped, while all the rest were
carried back. After that I ran the lines to Butler whenever
he wanted to see me, until it wasn’t safe for me to go back to
Richmond, where my operations had become known.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After the war was over, and our troops had possession,”
added Mr. W——, “then I came back, and saw what I had
never expected to see in this world. I saw the very men who
had robbed, persecuted, and imprisoned me, rewarded by our
government. I came back to find that under the administration
of our own generals, Ord and Patrick, it was in a man’s favor
to be known as a secessionist, and against him to be known as
a Union man. The Union men were insulted and bullied by
them, the colored people were treated worse under their rule
than they had ever been by the Rebels themselves, and the
secessionists were coaxed and petted. A Rebel could obtain
from government whatever he asked for; but a Union man
could obtain nothing. When we were feeding and flattering
them at a rate that made every loyal man sick at heart, I sent
a request in writing for a little hay for my horse. I got a
refusal in writing: I couldn’t have any hay. At the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>time the government was feeding in its stables thirty horses
for General Lee and his staff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A hundred similar instances of partiality shown to the
Rebels by the Ord and Patrick administration were related
to me by eye-witnesses; coupled with accounts of insults and
outrages heaped upon loyal men and Freedmen. Happily Ord
and Patrick and their pro-slavery rule had passed away; but
there were still complaints that it was not the true Union men
who had the ear of the government, but those whose unionism
had been put on as a matter of policy and convenience. This
was no fault of General Terry, although he was blamed for
it. When I told him what I had heard, he said warmly,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why don’t these men come to me? They are the very
men I wish to see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The truth is, General, they were snubbed so often by
your predecessors that they have not the heart to come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I have not snubbed them. I have not shown partiality
to traitors. Everybody that knows me knows that I
have no love for slavery or treason, and that every pulse of
my heart throbs with sympathy for these men and the cause
in which they have suffered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One evening I met by appointment, at the tent of the
Union Commission, a number of the dauntless twenty-one,
and accompanied them to a meeting of the Union League. It
was a beautiful night, and as we walked by the rainy fountain,
under the still trees, one remarked,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many an evening, when there was as pretty a moon as
this, I have wished that I might die and be out of my misery.
That was when I was in prison for being loyal to my country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the rooms of the League I was surrounded by these
men, nearly every one of whom had been exiled or imprisoned
for that cause. I witnessed the initiation of new-comers;
but in the midst of the impressive solemnities I could not but
reflect, “How faint a symbol is this of the <em>real League</em> to which
the twenty-one were sworn in their hearts! To belong to this
is now safe and easy enough; but to have been a true member
of that, under the reign of terror,—how very different!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>MARKETS AND FARMING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The negro population of Richmond gives to its streets a
peculiarly picturesque and animated appearance. Colored faces
predominate; but of these not more than one in five or six
shows unmixed African blood; and you are reminded less of
an American city than of some town of Southern Europe.
More than once I could have fancied myself in Naples, but
that I looked in vain for the crowds of importunate beggars,
and the dark-skinned <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">lazzaroni</span> lying all day in the sunshine
on the street corners. I saw no cases of mendicancy among
the colored people of Richmond, and very little idleness. The
people found at work everywhere belonged to the despised
race; while the frequenters of bar-rooms, and loungers on
tavern-steps, were white of skin. To get drunk, especially,
appeared to be a prerogative of the chivalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mules and curious vehicles one sees add to the picturesqueness
of the streets. The market-carts are characteristically
droll. A little way off you might fancy them dogcarts.
Under their little ribbed canvas covers are carried
little jags of such produce as the proprietor may have to sell,—a
few cabbages, a few pecks of sweet potatoes, a pair of
live chickens, tied together by the legs; a goose or a duck in
a box, its head sticking out; with perhaps a few eggs and eggplants.
These little carts, drawn by a mule or the poorest
of ponies, have been driven perhaps a dozen or fifteen miles,
bringing to market loads, a dozen of which would scarcely
equal what a New-York farmer, or a New-England market-gardener
often heaps upon a single wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the markets, business is transacted on the same petty
scale. You see a great number of dealers, and extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>throngs of purchasers, considering the little that appears to be
sold. Not every producer has so much even as an antiquated
mule-cart. Many come to market with what they can carry
on their backs or in their hands. Yonder is an old negro
with a turkey, which he has walked five miles to dispose of
here. That woman with a basket of eggs, whose rags and
sallow complexion show her to be one of the poor whites whom
respectable colored people look down upon, has travelled, it
may be, quite as far. Here comes a mulatto boy, with a string
of rock-fish caught in the James. This old man has hard
peaches in his bag; and that other woman contributes a box
of wild grapes.</p>

<p class='c000'>People of all colors and all classes surround the sheds or press
in throngs through the passages between the stalls. The fine
lady, followed by her servant bearing a basket, has but little
money; and although she endeavors to make it go as far as
possible, it must be a small family that can subsist until Monday
upon what she carries away. There is little money to
be seen anywhere; in which respect these scenes are very
different from those witnessed during the last years of Confederate
rule, when it was said that people went to market with
baskets to carry their money, and wallets to bring home what
it would buy. The markets are not kept open during the
evening, and as the hour for closing them arrives, the bargaining
and loud talking grow more and more vivacious, while
prices decline. I remember one fellow who jumped upon his
table, and made a speech, designed to attract the patronage
of the freedmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Walk up hyer, and buy cheap!” he shouted. “I don’t
say niggers; I say ladies and gentlemen. Niggers is played
out; they’re colored people now, and as good as anybody.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The markets indicate the agricultural enterprise of a community.
Yet, even after seeing those of Richmond, I was
amazed at the petty and shiftless system of farming I witnessed
around the city. I was told that it was not much better before
the war. The thrifty vegetable gardens of the North, producing
two or three crops a year; the long rows of hot-beds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>by the fences, starting cucumbers and supplying the market
with greens sometimes before the snow is gone,—such things
are scarcely known in the capital of Virginia. “We have
lettuce but a month or two in the year,” said a lady, who was
surprised to learn how Northern gardeners managed to produce
it in and out of season.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one of my rides I passed the place of a Jersey farmer,
about three miles from the city. It looked like an oasis in the
desert. I took pains to make the proprietor’s acquaintance,
and learn his experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I came here and bought in ’59 one hundred and twenty-seven
acres for four thousand dollars. The first thing I did
was to build that barn. Everybody laughed at me. The
most of the farms have no barns at all; and such a large one
was a wonder,—it must have been built by a fool or a crazy
man. This year I have that barn full to the rafters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I found the land worn out, like nearly all the land in the
country. The way Virginia folks have spoilt their farms looks
a good deal more like fools or crazy men than my barn. First,
if there was timber, they burnt it off and put a good coat of
ashes on the soil. Then they raised tobacco three or four
years. Then corn, till the soil got run out and they couldn’t
raise anything. Then they went to putting on guano, which
was like giving rum to an exhausted man; it just stimulated
the soil till all the strength there was left was burnt out.
That was the condition of my farm when I came here.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first thing I did, I went to hauling out manure from
Richmond. I was laughed at for that too. The way people
do here, they throw away their manure. They like to have
their farm-yards high and dry; so they place them on the
side of a hill, where every rain washes them, and carries off
into the streams the juices that ought to be saved for the land.
They left their straw-stacks any number of years, then drew
the straw out on the farms dry. I made my barn-yard in a
hollow, and rotted the straw in it. Now I go to market every
day with a big Jersey farm-wagon loaded down with stuff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been getting rich, notwithstanding the war. I
asked what labor he employed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Negro labor mostly. It was hard to get any other here.
I didn’t own slaves, but hired them of their masters. Only
the poorest hands were usually hired out in that way; I could
seldom get first-class hands; yet I always found that by kind
treatment and encouragement I could make very good laborers
of those I had. I get along still better with them now they
are free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you use horses?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; mules altogether. Two mules are equal to three
horses. Mules are not subject to half the diseases horses are.
They eat less, and wear twice as long.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I found farms of every description for sale, around Richmond.
The best land on the James River Bottom could be
bought at prices varying from forty to one hundred dollars an
acre. I remember one very desirable estate, of eight hundred
acres, lying on the river, three miles from the city, which was
offered for sixty dollars. There were good buildings on it;
and the owner was making fences of old telegraph wire, to
replace those destroyed during the war.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>IN AND AROUND RICHMOND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If temples are a token of godliness, Richmond should be a
holy city. It has great pride in its churches; two of which
are noteworthy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first is St. John’s Church, on Church Hill,—a large,
square-looking wooden meeting-house, whose ancient walls
and rafters once witnessed a famous scene, and reëchoed
words that have become historical. Here was delivered
Patrick Henry’s celebrated speech, since spouted by every
schoolboy,—“Give me liberty or give me death!” Those
shining sentences still hang like a necklace on the breast of
American Liberty. The old meeting-house stands where it
stood, overlooking the same earth and the same beautiful
stream. But the men of that age lie buried in the dust of
these old crowded church-yards; and of late one might almost
have said that the wisdom of Virginia lay buried with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the corner of Grace Street, opposite my hotel, I looked
out every morning upon the composite columns and pilasters,
and spire clean as a stiletto, of St. Paul’s Church, with which
are connected very different associations. This is the church,
and (if you enter) yonder is the pew, in which Jeff Davis
sat on Sundays, and heard the gospel of Christ interpreted
from the slave-owners’ point of view. Here he sat on that
memorable Sabbath when Lee’s dispatch was handed in to
him, saying that Richmond was lost. The same preacher who
preached on that day, still propounds his doctrines from the
desk. The same sexton who handed in the dispatch glances
at you, and, if you are well dressed, offers you a seat in a
good place. The same white congregation that arose then
in confusion and dismay, on seeing the President go out, sit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>quietly once more in their seats; and the same colored congregation
looks down from the nigger gallery. The seats are
still bare,—the cushions that were carried to the Rebel hospitals,
to serve as mattresses, having not yet been returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within an arrow’s shot from St. Paul’s, in the State
Capitol, on Capitol Square, were the halls of the late Confederate
Congress. I visited them only once, and found them a
scene of dust and confusion,—emblematical. The desks and
seats had been ripped up, and workmen were engaged in
sweeping out the last vestiges of Confederate rule. The furniture,
as I learned, was already at an auction-room on Main
Street, selling under the hammer. I reported the fact to Mr.
C——, of the Union Commission, who was looking for furniture
to be used in the freedmen’s schools; and he made haste
to bid for the relics. I hope he got them; for I can fancy no
finer stroke of poetical justice than the conversion of the seats
on which sat the legislators of the great slave empire, and the
desks on which they wrote, into seats and desks for little negro
children learning to read.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was interesting, by the light of recent events, and in
company with one who knew Richmond of yore, to make the
tour of the old negro auction-rooms. Davis &amp; Co.’s Negro
Bazaar was fitting up for a concert hall. We entered a
grocery store,—a broad basement room, with a low, dark
ceiling, supported by two stout wooden pillars. “I’ve seen
many a black Samson sold, standing between those posts; and
many a woman too, as white as you or I.” Now sugar and
rice were sold there, but no more human flesh and blood.
The store was kept by a Northern man, who did not even
know what use the room had served in former years.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short ride from the city are two cemeteries worth visiting.
On one side, Hollywood, where lie buried President
Monroe and his doctrine. On the other side, Oak Wood, a
wild, uncultivated hill, half covered with timber and brush,
shading numerous Confederate soldiers’ graves. Here, set
apart from the rest by a rude fence, is the “Yankee Cemetery,”
crowded with the graves of patriot soldiers, who fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>in battle, or died of slow starvation and disease in Richmond
prisons; a melancholy field, which I remember as I saw it
one gusty September day, when wild winds swept it, and
shook down over it whirling leaves from the reeling and
roaring trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieut. M——, of the Freedmen’s Commission, having
invited me to visit Camp Lee, about two miles from the city,
came for me one afternoon in a fine large carryall, comfortably
covered, cushioned, and carpeted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps you will not feel honored,” he remarked, as we
rattled up Broad Street, “but you will be interested to know
that this is General Robert E. Lee’s head-quarters’ wagon.
You are riding on the seat he rode on through the campaigns
of the last two years. Your feet are on a piece of carpet
which one of the devoted secessionists of Richmond took
up from his hall-floor expressly to line the General’s wagon-bottom,—little
thinking Yankee boot-soles would ever desecrate
it! After Lee’s surrender, this wagon was turned over
to the quartermaster’s department, and the quartermaster
turned it over to us.” I was interested, indeed; I was carried
back to those sanguinary campaigns; and I fancied I
could see the face of him sitting there where I sat, and read
the thoughts of his mind, and the emotions of his heart, in
those momentous nights and days. I imagined the plans he
revolved in his brain, shut in by those dark curtains; what he
felt after victory, and what after defeat; the weariness of
body and soul; the misgivings, the remorse, when he remembered
his treason and the folly of Virginia,—for he certainly
remembered them in the latter gloomy periods, when
he saw the black cloud of doom settling down upon a bad and
failing cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Camp Lee, formerly a fair ground, was the conscript camp
of the Confederacy. I had been told many sad stories of young
men, and men of middle age, some of them loyal, seized by
the conscript officers and sent thither, as it were to a reservoir
of the people’s blood, whose stream was necessary to keep the
machinery of despotism in motion. I paced the grounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>where, with despairing hearts, they took their first lessons in
the art by which they were to slay and be slain. I stood by
the tree under which deserters were shot. Then I turned to
a very different scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old barrack buildings were now the happy homes of a
village of freedmen. Groups of barefooted and woolly-headed
negro children were at play before the doors, filling the air
with their laughter, and showing all their ivory with grins of
delight as I passed among them. The old men took off their
caps to me, the wise old aunties welcomed me with dignified
smiles, and the younger women looked up brightly from their
ironing or cooking as I went by. The young men were all
away at their work. It was, with few exceptions, a self-supporting
community, only about a dozen old or infirm persons,
out of three hundred, receiving aid from the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little removed from the negro village was a cottage formerly
occupied by Confederate officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that house,” said the Lieutenant, “is living a very remarkable
character. You know him by reputation, ——, formerly
one of the ablest writers on ‘De Bow’s Review,’ and
considered the great champion of slavery in the South.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! the author of ——?” a somewhat celebrated
book in its day, and in the latitude for which it was written;
designed to set forth the corrupt and perishable nature of free
societies and progressive ideas, and to show that slavery was
the one divine and enduring institution.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The very man. He is now a pauper, living on the bounty
of the government. The rent of that cottage is given him,
and he draws rations of the Relief Commission. He will be
glad to see you; and he has two accomplished daughters you
will be glad to see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly we called upon him; but, declining to enter the
house, we sat under the stoop, where we could look across the
desolate country at the sunset sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. ——, an emaciated, sallow, feeble old man, received
us affably, and talked with us freely on his favorite topics.
He had lived to see the one divine and enduring institution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>die; but civilization still survived; and the race that found its
welfare and happiness only in bondage seemed pretty well off,
and tolerably happy,—witness the negro village close by: and
the world of progressive ideas still moved on. Yet this great
champion of slavery did not appear to have learned the first
lesson of the times. All his arguments were the old arguments;
he knew nothing but the past, which was gone forever;
and the future to him was chaos.</p>

<p class='c000'>His two daughters, young and accomplished, came and sat
with us in the twilight, together with a vivacious young lady
from Richmond. On our return to the city, Miss ——
accompanied us, with their visitor. The latter proved to be
an audacious and incorrigible little Rebel, and regaled us with
secesh songs. I remember a few lines.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>PEOPLE AND POLITICS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One day I dined at the house of a Union man of a different
stamp from the twenty-one I have mentioned. He was
one of the wealthy citizens of Richmond,—a man of timid
disposition and conservative views, who had managed admirably
to conceal his Union sentiments during the war. He
had been on excellent terms with Jeff Davis and members
of his cabinet; and he was now on excellent terms with the
United States authorities. A prudent citizen, not wanting in
kindness of heart; yet he could say of the Emancipation
Act,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will prove a good thing for the slave-owners; for it
will be quite as cheap to hire our labor as to own it, <em>and we
shall now be rid of supporting the old and decrepit servants,
such as were formerly left to die on our hands</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On being asked if he considered that he owed nothing
to those aged servants, he smoothed his chin, and looked
thoughtful, but made no reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>An anecdote will show of what stuff the Unionism of this
class is composed. His name happened to be the same as
that of one of our generals. During the war, a Confederate
officer, visiting his house, said to him,—“I am told you are a
near relative of General ——, of the Federal army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a slander!” was the indignant reply. “He is no
kin of mine, and I would disown him if he was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After the occupation by our troops, Union officers were
welcomed at his house; one of whom said to him,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you related to our famous General ——?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely, very likely,” was the complacent answer;
“the ——’s are all connected.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Next to the uncompromising Union men, the most sincerely
loyal Virginians I saw in Richmond, or elsewhere, were
those who had been lately fighting against us. Only now
and then a Confederate soldier had much of the spirit of the
Rebellion left in him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The truth is,” said Colonel D——, “we have had the
devil whipped out of us. It is only those who kept out of
the fight that are in favor of continuing it. I fought you with
all my might until we got whipped; then I gave it up as a
bad job; and now there’s not a more loyal man in the United
States than I am.” He had become thoroughly converted
from the heresy of secession. “No nation can live that tolerates
such a doctrine; and, if we had succeeded, the first
thing we should have done would have been to repudiate it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I became acquainted with several officers of this class, who
inspired me with confidence and sympathy. Yet when one of
them told me he had been awarded a government place, with
four thousand a year, I could not help saying,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“What right have you to such a place? How many capable
and worthy men, who have been all the while fighting <em>for</em>
the government you have been fighting <em>against</em>, would be
thankful for a situation with one half or one quarter the
salary!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The animus of the secessionists who kept out of the war,
and especially of the women, still manifested itself spitefully
on occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is amusing,” said Mrs. W——, “to see the pains some
of them take to avoid walking under the flag we keep flying
over our door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Two female teachers of the freed people had, after much
trouble, obtained board and lodgings in a private family,
where the treatment they received was such as no sensitive
person could endure. They were obliged to leave, and accept
quarters in a Confederate government building not much
better than a barn. Many Richmond families were glad
enough to board army officers for their money; but few
were prepared to receive and treat decently “nigger teachers,”
at any price.</p>

<p>INDUSTRY OF LADIES IN CLOTHING THE SOLDIERS, AND ZEAL IN URGING THEIR BEAUX TO GO TO THE WAR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Yet the people of Richmond are not what they were five
years ago,” said General S——, who knew them well, being
himself a Virginian. “Their faces have changed. They
have a dazed look, like owls in a sudden light. To any one
who used to see them in the old days of their pride and spirit,
this is very striking. There never was such a downfall, and
they have not yet recovered from the shock. They seem to
be groping about, as if they had lost something, or were waiting
for something. Whatever may be said of them, or whatever
they may say of themselves, they feel that they are a
conquered people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They <em>were</em> a conquered people,” said the radical Union
men. “There never was a rebellious class more thoroughly
subdued. They expected no mercy from the government, for
they deserved none. They were prepared to submit to everything,
even to negro suffrage; for they supposed nothing less
would be required of them. But the more lenient the government,
the more arrogant they become.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Confederate patriotism I did not hear very favorable
accounts. It burst forth in a beautiful tall flame at the beginning
of the war. There were soldiers’ aid societies, patronized
by ladies whose hands were never before soiled by labor.
Stockings were knit, shirts cut and sewed, and carpets converted
into blankets, by these lovely hands. If a fine fellow
appeared among them, more inclined to gallantry in the parlor
than to gallantry in the field, these same lovely hands thrust
him out, and he was told that “only ‘the brave deserve the
fair.’” But Southern heat is flashy and intense; it does not
hold out like the slow, deep fire of the north. The soldiers’
aid societies soon grew to be an old story, and the lovely ones
contented themselves with cheering and waving their handkerchiefs
when the “noble defenders of the south” marched
through the streets.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “noble defenders of the south” did not, I regret to
say, appreciate the cheers and the handkerchiefs as they did
the shirts and the blankets.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many a time,” said Mrs. H——, “I have heard them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>yell back at the ladies who cheered them, ‘Go to ——! If
you care for us, come out of your fine clothes and help us!’
After the people stopped giving, the soldiers began to help
themselves. I’ve seen them rush into stores as they passed,
snatch whatever they wanted, and march on again, hooting,
with loaves of bread and pieces of meat stuck on the points
of their bayonets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sons and brothers of influential families were kept out
of the war by an ingenious system of details. Every man was
conscripted; but, while the poor and friendless were hurried
away to fight the battles of slavery, the favored aristocrat
would get “detailed” to fill some “bomb-proof” situation, as
it was called.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These ‘bomb-proofs’ finally got to be a very great nuisance.
Men were ‘detailed’ to fill every comfortable berth
the government, directly or indirectly, had anything to do
with; and as the government usurped, in one way or another,
nearly all kinds of business, it soon became difficult for an old
or infirm person to get any sort of light employment. A
friend of mine, whom the war had ruined, came down from
the country, thinking he could get something to do here. He
saw able-bodied young men oiling the wheels of the cars. He
was old and lame, but he felt himself well able to do that kind
of work. So he applied for a situation, and found that the
young men he saw were ‘detailed’ from the army. Others
were ‘detailed’ to carry lanterns for them when they had
occasion to oil the car-wheels at night. It was so with every
situation the poor man could have filled.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the testimony of a candid old gentleman, himself
an aristocrat, at whose house I passed an evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took an early opportunity to make the acquaintance of
Governor Pierpoint, whom I found to be a plain, somewhat
burly, exceedingly good-humored and sociable person. The
executive mansion occupies pleasant grounds, enclosed from a
corner of Capitol Square; and as it was not more than three
minutes’ walk from my hotel, I found it often very agreeable
to go over and spend a leisure hour or two in his library.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Once I remarked to him: “What Virginia needs is an influx
of Northern ideas, Northern energy, Northern capital;
what other way of salvation is open to her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None; and she knows it. It is a mistake to suppose that
Northern men and Northern capital are not welcome here.
They are most heartily welcome; they are invited. Look at
this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He showed me a beautiful piece of white clay, and a handsome
pitcher made from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Within eighty miles of Richmond, by railroad, there are
beds of this clay from which might be manufactured pottery
and porcelain sufficient to supply the entire South. Yet they
have never been worked; and Virginia has imported all her
fine crockery-ware. Now Northern energy will come in and
coin fortunes out of that clay. Under the old labor system,
Virginia never had any enterprise; and now she has no
money. The advantages she offers to active business men
were never surpassed. Richmond is surrounded with iron
mines and coal-fields, wood-lands and farm-lands of excellent
quality; and is destined from its very position, under the new
order of things, to run up a population of two or three hundred
thousand, within not many years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired about the state finances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Rebel State debt will, of course, never be paid. The
old State debt, amounting to forty millions, will eventually be
paid, although the present is a dark day for it. There is no
live stock to eat the grass; the mills are destroyed; business
is at a stand-still; there is no bank-stock to tax,—nothing to
tax, I might almost say, but the bare land. We shall pay no
interest on the debt this year; and it will probably be three
years before the back interest is paid. We have twenty-two
millions invested in railroads, and these will all be put in a living
condition in a short time. Then I count upon the development
of our natural resources. In mineral wealth and agricultural
advantages Virginia is inconceivably rich, as a few years will
amply testify.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As an illustration of native enterprise, he told me that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>was but one village containing fifty inhabitants on the canal
between Richmond and Lynchburg, a distance of one hundred
and fifty miles; and land lying upon it was worth no more
to-day than it was before the canal was constructed. “Neither
is there a village of any size on the James River, between Richmond
and Norfolk. How long would it be before brick villages
and manufacturing towns would spring up on such a canal
and river in one of the free States? Wasn’t it about time,”
he added, “for the old machine to break to pieces?”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the hotel I used to meet a prosperous looking, liberal
faced, wide-awake person, whom I at once set down as a Yankee.
On making his acquaintance, I learned that he was at
the head of a company of Northern men who had recently
purchased extensive coal-fields near the James River, twelve
miles above Richmond.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The mines,” he said, “had been exhausted once, and
abandoned, so we bought them cheap. These Virginians
would dig a little pit and take out coal until water came in
and interfered with their work; then they would go somewhere
else and dig another little pit. So they worked over
the surface of the fields, but left the great body of the coal
undisturbed. They baled with a mule. Now we have come
in with a few steam-pumps which will keep the shafts free
from water as fast as we sink them; and we are taking out cargoes
of as good anthracite as ever you saw. Here is some
of it now,” pointing to a line of loaded carts coming up from
the wharf, where the coal was landed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked what labor he employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Negro labor. There is none better. I have worked
negroes all my life, and prefer them in my business to any
other class of laborers. Treat a negro like a man, and you
make a man of him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I also made the acquaintance of a New Yorker, who was working
a gold mine in Orange County, Va., and whose testimony
was the same with regard to native methods and negro labor.
In short, wherever I went, I became, every day, more strongly
convinced that the vast, beautiful, rich, torpid state of Virginia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>was to owe her regeneration to Northern ideas and free
institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing loud laughter in the court-house one evening, I
looked in, and saw a round, ruddy, white-haired, hale old man
making a humorous speech to a mixed crowd of respectable
citizens and rowdies. It was the Honorable Mr. P——,
bidding for their votes. A played-out politician, he had disappeared
from public view a quarter of a century before, but
had now come up again, thinking there was once more a chance
for himself in the paucity of able men, whom the barrier of
the test-oath left eligible to Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for that oath,” said he, with a solemn countenance,
“I confess it is a bitter cup; and I have prayed that it might
pass from me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he paused, and took a sip of brandy from a glass on
the desk before him. Evidently that cup wasn’t so bitter,
for he smacked his lips, and looked up with a decidedly refreshed
expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fellow-citizens,” said he, “I am going to tell you a little
story,”—clapping his cane under his arm, and peering under
his gray eyebrows. “It will show you my position with regard
to that abominable oath. In the good old Revolutionary
times, there lived somewhere on the borders a pious Scotchman,
whose farm was run over one day by the red-coats, and
the next by the Continentals; so that it required the most
delicate manœuvering on his part to keep so much as a pig or
a sheep (to say nothing of his own valuable neck) safe from
the two armies. Now what did this pious Scotchman do? In
my opinion he did very wisely. When the red-coats caught
him, he took the oath of allegiance to the Crown. The next
day, when the Continentals picked him up, he took the same
oath to the Continental Congress. Now, being a deacon of
the Presbyterian Church, in good and regular standing, certain
narrow-minded brethren saw fit to remonstrate with him,
asking how he could reconcile his conscience to such a course.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’My friends,’ said he, ‘I have thought over the matter,
and I have prayed over it; and I have concluded that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>safer to trust my soul in the hands of a merciful God, than
my property in the hands of those thieving rascals.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fellow-citizens,” resumed the candidate, after a storm of
laughter on the part of the crowd, and another a sip of the cup
not bitter, on his part, “I have thought over it, and prayed
over it, and I have concluded that I can conscientiously take
that abominable test-oath; in other words, that it is safer to
trust my soul in the hands of a merciful God, than my
country in the hands of the Black Republicans.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He then proceeded to malign the people of the North, and
to misrepresent their motives, in a spirit of buffoonery and
shameless mendacity, which amazed me. The more outrageous
the lies he told, the louder the screams of applause
from his delighted audience. I could not have helped laughing
at the ludicrousness of his caricatures, had I not seen that
they passed for true pictures with a majority of his hearers; or
had I not remembered that it was such reckless political lying
as this, which had so lately misled to their ruin the ignorant
masses of the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having finished his speech and his brandy, he sat down;
and a rival candidate mounted the platform.</p>

<p class='c000'>“B——! B——!” shrieked the ungrateful crowd, clapping
and stamping as frantically for the new speaker as for
him who had labored so long for their amusement. Thereupon,
the Honorable Mr. P——, pitching his hat over his
eyes, and brandishing his cane, advanced upon his rival.</p>

<p class='c000'>B——, a much younger and more slender man, quietly
stripped up his coat-sleeves, exposing his linen to the elbows,
and showing himself prepared for emergencies; whereat the
yells became deafening. A few words passed between the
rival candidates; after which B—— folded his arms and permitted
P—— to make an explanation. It appeared from this
that P—— had written to B——, inviting him to become a
candidate for Congress. B—— had declined. Then P——
came forward as a candidate; and then B——, changing his
mind, said he would be a candidate too. Hence their quarrel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Calmly, with his sleeves still up, or ready to come up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>for P—— was continually advancing upon him with cane
lifted and hat set fiercely on his head,—B—— replied, giving
his version of the misunderstanding. He admitted that
P—— had written him such a letter. “But his suggestion
with regard to my becoming a candidate was very feeble,
while the intimation which accompanied it, that he meant to
run if I didn’t, was very strong; reminding me of the
boarder at the hotel-table, who coveted a certain dish of
cakes. ‘Here, waiter,’ said he, ‘see if any of the gentlemen
will have these cakes, for if they won’t, I will.’ Of
course I declined the cakes. But they have been passed to
me by others in a very different spirit, and now I mean to
have them if I can get them,—with all deference to the
appetite of my venerable friend.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The crowd hooted, shrieked, roared. “Venerable friend”
grasped his glass savagely, but, finding it empty, dashed it
down again, and sprang to his feet. Desperately puffed, red
in the face, once more whirling his cane aloft and knocking
his hat over his brows, I thought, if he did not first get a
stroke of apoplexy, B—— would this time surely get a stroke
of the stick. But B—— grimly stood his ground; and,
after glaring at him a moment as if about to burst, P——
muttered, “Go to the devil, then!” buttoned his coat, gave
his hat another knock, and stalked out of the house amid a
tumult of merriment and derision.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly always, on such occasions, the disputant who loses
his temper, loses his cause. B—— now had everything his
own way; and a very good speech he made. He was one of
those original Union men who had at first opposed secession,
but afterwards yielded to the storm that swept over the State.
Sent to the Convention to oppose it there, he had ended by voting
for it, under instructions from his constituency. He had
kept aloof from war and politics during the Rebellion, and
could take the test oath; that was no such bitter cup to him.
He spoke very feelingly of the return of Virginia to her place
in the Union; praised the government for its clemency and
moderation, and advocated a forbearing policy towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>freedmen, whom the previous speaker wished to see driven
out of the State; seasoning his speech for the vulgar with
timely panegyrics on the heroism of the Confederate soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The election took place a few days later; and I thought it
creditable to the good sense of the district that the younger
candidate was chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the political views of the people, or of the real sentiments
of the speakers themselves, not much was to be learned
at such a meeting. The heart of the South was boiling with
thoughts and emotions which did not come openly to the surface.
On the subject of the national debt, for example. Public
speakers and public prints were ominously silent about it;
and seldom could a discreet citizen be induced to speak of it
with any degree of frankness. I was plainly told, however,
by a gentleman of Richmond, that the question was often
privately discussed, and that the secessionists would never, if
they could help it, submit to be taxed to pay the expenses of
their own subjugation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how is it proposed to help it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first step is to resume their place in the Union.
Until that is accomplished, they will remain silent on this
and some other delicate subjects. They hope gradually to
regain their old power in the nation, when they will unite
with the Democratic party of the North, and repudiate the
debt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If I could have been seriously alarmed by such a prospect,
what I witnessed at political meetings and elsewhere, would
have done much to dispel my apprehensions. I was strongly
impressed by this important fact. The old trained politicians,—whom
a common interest, slavery, banded together, and
whom no consideration of reason or justice could turn from
their purpose,—that formidable phalanx had been broken:
nearly every man of them had taken an active part in the Rebellion,
and could not therefore, without shameful recreancy
and voluntary humiliation on the part of the North, be readmitted
to the councils of the nation they had attempted to
destroy. In their place we may for some years hope to see a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>very different class of men, whose youth, or modesty, or
good fortune, or good sense, before kept them aloof from
political life; men new to the Congressional arena, and therefore
more susceptible to the regenerating influence of national
ideas and institutions.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>FORTIFICATIONS.—DUTCH GAP.—FAIR OAKS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At nine o’clock one fine morning, Major K——, the
young Judge-Advocate of the Department of Virginia, called
for me by appointment, accompanied by an orderly bringing
a tall war-horse General Terry was so kind as to furnish for
my use.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was soon mounted, and riding out of the city by the
Major’s side,—down the long, hilly street, past the Rocketts,
by the left bank of the river, taking the New-Market Road.
First we came to a circle of detached forts surrounding the
city; a few minutes’ ride farther on brought us to a heavy
continuous line of earthworks surrounding the first line.
These were the original fortifications of Richmond. Crossing
a desolate undulating country of weeds and undergrowth, we
reached the works below Laurel Hill, of more recent construction,
and of a more formidable character. The embankments
were eighteen feet high from the bottom of the ditch. This
was some six feet deep and twelve broad. There were two
lines of bristling abatis. These, together with the wooden
revetments of the works, had been levied upon by the inhabitants
in search of firewood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three quarters of a mile beyond we came to the heavy
intrenchments of the Army of the James. Between the two
lines were the picket-lines of the opposing forces, in places no
more than three hundred yards apart. Here the two armies
lay and watched each other through the last weary Autumn
and Winter of the war. The earth was blotched with “gopher
holes,”—hasty excavations in which the veteran videttes proceeded
at once to intrench themselves, on being sent out to a
new post. “It was astonishing,” said the Major, “to see
what a breastwork they would throw up in a few minutes,
with no other tools than a bayonet and a tin-plate. The moment
they were at their station, down they went, scratching
and digging.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
<img src='images/i_199.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>We had previously stopped at Laurel Hill, to look across
the broken country on the south, at Fort Gilmer, which the
troops of General Foster’s division charged with such unfortunate
results. The Major, then serving on Foster’s staff, participated
in that affair. “I never can look upon this field,”
said he, “without emotion. I lost some of my dearest friends
in that assault.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So it is in every battle: <em>somebody</em> loses his dearest friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode on past the Federal works into the winter-quarters
of the army,—a city of huts, with streets regularly laid out,
now deserted and in ruins. Here and there I noted an old-fashioned
New-England well-sweep still standing. The line
of works was semicircular, both ends resting on the river.
Within that ox-bow was the encampment of the Army of the
James.</p>

<p class='c000'>We next visited New-Market Heights, where Butler’s colored
regiments formed unflinchingly under fire, and made
their gallant charge, wiping out with their own blood the
insults that had been heaped upon them by the white troops.
“The army saw that charge, and it never insulted a colored
soldier after that,” said the Major.</p>

<p class='c000'>We then galloped across the country, intending to strike
Dutch Gap Canal. Not a habitation was in sight. Vast fields
spread before us, and we rode through forests of weeds that
overtopped our horses’ heads. We became entangled in earthworks,
and had to retrace our course. More than once we
were compelled to dismount and tear our way through abatis
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</span></i><a id='t200'></a>. The result was, we lost our bearings,
and, after riding several miles quite blindly, struck the James
at Deep Bottom. Then up the river we galloped, traversing
pine woods and weedy plains, avoiding marsh and gully, and
leaping ditches, past Aiken’s Landing, to a yellow elevation of
earth across a narrow peninsula, which proved to be Dutch
Gap.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The canal was there,—a short, deep channel connecting the
river with the river again. The James here describes a long
loop, seven miles in extent, doubling back upon itself, so that
you may stand on this high bank, and throw a stone either
into the southward-flowing or the northward-returning stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>The canal, which cuts off these seven miles, is four hundred
and eighty-six feet in length and fifty in depth from the summit
of the bank. It is one hundred and twenty-two feet broad
at the top, forty at the bottom, and sixty-five at the high-water
level. On the lower side the channel is deep enough
for ships. Not so at the upper end,—the head that was
blown out having fallen back and filled up the canal. At high
water, however, small vessels sometimes get through. The
tide had just turned, and we found a considerable body of
water pouring through the Gap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Different accounts are given of the origin of the name of
Dutch Gap. It is said that a Dutch company was once formed
for digging a ship-canal at that place. But a better story is
told of a Dutchman who made a bet with a Virginian, that
he could beat him in a skiff-race between Richmond and City
Point. The Virginian was ahead when they reached the Gap;
what then was his astonishment, on arriving at City Point, to
find the Dutchman there before him. The latter had saved
the roundabout seven miles by dragging his canoe across the
peninsula and launching it on the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding up the Richmond road, we stopped at the first human
habitation we had seen since leaving Laurel Hill. We had
been several hours in the saddle, and stood greatly in need of
refreshments. The sight of a calf and a churn gave us a
promise of milk, and we tied our horses at the door. The
house had been a goodly mansion in its day, but now everything
about it showed the ruin and dilapidation of war. The
windows were broken, and the garden, out-houses, and fences
destroyed. This proved to be Cox’s house, and belonged to a
plantation of twenty-three hundred acres which included
Dutch Gap. Looking at the desolation which surrounded it,
I could hardly believe that this had formerly been one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>finest farms in Virginia, worked by a hundred negroes, and
furnished with reapers, threshers, a grist-mill, and saw-mill,—all
of which had been swept away as if they had never been.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found lying on a bed in a dilapidated room a poor man
sick with the prevailing chills. He had some bread and milk
brought for us, and gave us some useful hints about avoiding
the torpedoes when we should reach Fort Harrison. He described
to us the depredations committed on the place by “Old
Butler”; and related how he himself was once taken prisoner
by the Yankee marines on the river. “They gave me my
choice,—to be carried before the admiral, or robbed of my
horse and all the money I had about me. I preferred the
robbing; so they cleared me out and set me free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said, “If you had been taken before the admiral, you
would have got your liberty and saved your property.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His voice became deep and tremulous as he replied: “But
I didn’t consider horse nor money; I considered my wife. I’d
sooner anything than that she should be distressed. She knew
I was a prisoner, and all I thought of was to hurry home to
her with the news that I was safe.” Thus in every human
breast, even though wrapped in rags, and guilty of crimes
against country and kindred, abides the eternal spark of tenderness
which atones in the sight of God for all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking leave of the sick man, we paid a brief visit to the
casemates of Fort Harrison, then spurred back to Richmond,
which we reached at sunset, having been nine hours in the
saddle and ridden upwards of forty miles.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>Another morning, with two gentlemen of General Terry’s
staff, and an orderly to take care of our horses, I rode out of
the city on the Nine Mile Road, which crosses the Chickahominy
at New Bridge; purposing to visit some of the scenes
of McClellan’s Richmond campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the fortifications, and traversing a level, scarcely
inhabited country, shorn of its forests by the sickle of war, we
reached, by a cross-road, the line of the Richmond and York
River Railroad. But no railroad was there; the iron of the
track having been taken up to be used elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Near by was Fair Oaks Station, surrounded by old fields,
woods, and tracts of underbrush. Here was formerly a yard,
in which stood a group of oaks, the lower trunks of which had
been rendered conspicuous, if not beautiful, by whitewash:
hence, “<em>fair</em> oaks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wild, windy, dusty day. A tempest was roaring
through the pines over our heads as we rode on to the scene
of General Casey’s disaster. I asked an inhabitant why the
place was called “Seven Pines.” “I don’t know, unless it’s
because there’s about seven hundred.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was living in a little wooden house, close by a negro
hut. “The Yankees took me up, and carried me away, and
destroyed all I had. My place don’t look like it did before,
and never will, I reckon. They come again last October;
Old Butler’s devils; all colors; heap of black troops; they
didn’t leave me anything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke with no more respect of the Confederates. “We
had in our own army some of the durn’dest scapegalluses!
The difference ’twixt them and the Yankees was, the Yankees
would steal before our eyes, and laugh at us; but the Rebels
would steal behind our backs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the south, we found the woods on fire, with a furious
north wind fanning the flames. The only human being we
saw was a man digging sweet potatoes. We rode eastward,
along the lines of intrenchments thrown up by our troops
after the battle; passed through a low, level tract of woods,
on the borders of the Chickahominy swamps; and, pressing
northward, struck the Williamsburg Road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel G——, of our party, was in the Fair Oaks’ fight.
He came up with the victorious columns that turned back the
tide of defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never saw a handsomer sight than Sickles’s brigade advancing
up that road, Sunday morning, the second day of the
battle. The enemy fired upon them from these woods, but
never a man flinched. They came up in column, magnificently,
to that house yonder; then formed in line of battle
across these fields, and went in with flags flying and bayonets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>shining, and drove the Rebels. After that we might have
walked straight into Richmond, but McClellan had to stop
and go to digging.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We dismounted in a sheltered spot, to examine our maps,
then passed through the woods by a cross-road to Savage’s
Station, coming out upon a large undulating field. Of Savage’s
house only the foundations were left, surrounded by a
grove of locust-trees. My companions described to me the
scene of McClellan’s retreat from this place,—the hurry, the
confusion, the flames of government property abandoned and
destroyed. Sutlers forsook their goods. Even the officers’
baggage was devoted to the torch. A single pile of hard tack,
measuring forty cubic feet, was set on fire, and burned. Then
came the battle of Savage’s Station, in which the corps of
Franklin and Sumner, by determined fighting, saved our army
from being overwhelmed by the entire Rebel force. This was
Sunday again, the twenty-ninth of June: so great had been
the change wrought by four short weeks! On that other
Sunday the Rebels were routed, and the campaign, as some
aver, might have been gloriously ended by the capture of
Richmond. Now nothing was left for us but ignominious
retreat and failure, which proved all the more humiliating,
falling so suddenly upon the hopes with which real or fancied
successes had inspired the nation.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>IN AND ABOUT PETERSBURG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On Wednesday, September 27th, I left Richmond for Petersburg.
The railroad bridge having been burned, I crossed
the river in a coach, and took the cars at Manchester. A ride
of twenty miles through tracts of weeds and undergrowth,
pine barrens and oaken woods, passing occasionally a dreary-looking
house and field of “sorry” corn, brought us within
sight of the “Cockade City.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was evening when I arrived. Having a letter from
Governor Pierpoint to a prominent citizen, I sallied out by
moonlight from my hotel, and picked my way, along the
streets sloping up from the river bank, to his house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge —— received me in his library, and kept me until
a late hour listening to him. His conversation was of the
war, and the condition in which it had left the country. He
portrayed the ruin of the once proud and prosperous State,
and the sufferings of the people. “Yet, when all is told,”
said he, “you cannot realize their sufferings, more than if you
had never heard of them.” His remarks touching the freedmen
were refreshing, after the abundance of cant on the subject
to which I had been treated. He thought they were destined
to be crowded out of Virginia, which was adapted to white
labor, but that they would occupy the more southern States,
and become a useful class of citizens. Many were leaving
their homes, with the idea that they must do so in order fully
to assert their freedom; but the majority of them were still
at work for their old masters. He was already convinced
that the new system would prove more profitable to employers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>than the old one. Formerly he kept eight family servants;
now he had but three, who, stimulated by wages, did the
work of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his former servants, to whom he had granted many
privileges, came to him, after the war closed, and said, “You
a’n’t going to turn me away, I hope, master.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, William,” said the Judge. “As long as I have a
home, you have one. But I have no money to hire you.”
William replied that he would like to stay, and work right
along just as he had done hitherto. “And as for money,
master, I reckon we can manage that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How so, William?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, master, you’ve been so kind to me these past
years I’ve done a good deal outside, and if you have no money
now, I reckon I must lend you some.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The faithful fellow brought out his little treasure, and offered
it to his old master, who, however, had not the heart to accept
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Judge also told a story of a free negro to whom he had
often loaned money without security before the war. Recently
this negro had come to him again, and asked the old question,
“Have you plenty of money, master?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, James,” said the Judge, “I used to have plenty, and
I always gave you what you wanted, but you must go to somebody
else now, for I haven’t a dollar,”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s what I was thinking,” said James. “I haven’t
come to borrow this time, but to lend.” And, taking out a
fifty-dollar note, with tears in his eyes he entreated the
Judge to take it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I noticed that the library had a new door, and that the walls
around it were spotted with marks of repairs. “These are
the effects of a shell that paid us a flying visit one morning,
during the bombardment. Fortunately, no one was hurt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He accepted the results of the war in such a candid and
loyal spirit as I had rarely seen manifested by the late governing
class in Virginia. If such men could be placed in power,
the sooner the State were fully restored to its place in the
Union, the better; but, alas!—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Returning to the hotel, I missed my way, and seeing a light
in a little grocery store, went in to make inquiries. I found
two negroes talking over the bombardment. Finding me a
stranger, and interested, they invited me to stop, and rehearsed
the story for my benefit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shelling began on the first of July, 1864. It was most
rapid on the third. Roofs and chimneys and walls were
knocked to pieces. All the lower part of the town was deserted.
Many of the inhabitants fled to the country; some
remained there in camps, others got over their fright and returned.
“We went up on Market Street, and got into a
bomb-proof we made of cotton bales.” The bombardment was
kept up until the first of October, and afterwards resumed at
intervals. “Finally people got so they didn’t care anything
about it. I saw two men killed by picking up shells and looking
at them; they exploded in their hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the evacuation the negroes “had to keep
right dark” to avoid being carried away by their masters.
Some went across the Appomattox, and had to swim back,
the bridges being burned.</p>

<p class='c000'>They described to me the beauty of the scene when the
mortars were playing in the night, and the heavens were
spanned with arches of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a right glad day for us when the Rebels went out
and the Federals came in; and I don’t believe any of the
people could say with conscientiousness they were sorry,—they
had all suffered so much. The Rebels set all the tobacco-warehouses
afire, and burned up the foundery and commissary
stores. That was Sunday. Monday morning they went out,
and the Federals came in, track after track, without an hour
between them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These two negroes were brothers, and men of decided character
and intelligence, although they had been slaves all their
lives. They learned to read in a spelling-book when children
by the firelight of their hut. “I noticed how white children
called their letters; and afterwards I learned to write without
any showing, by copying the writing-letters in the spelling-book.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>I learned to read in such a silent manner, it was a long
time before I could make any head reading loud. I learned
arithmetic by myself in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If any person of white skin, who has risen to eminence, is
known to have acquired the rudiments of education under
such difficulties, much is made of the circumstance. But in
the case of a poor black man, a slave, I suppose it is different.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two addressed each other with great respect and affection.
Their feeling of kinship and of family worth was very
strong. “There were four brothers of us,” said the elder;
“and I am the only one of them that ever went to the prison-house.
After my old, kind master died, I had a difficulty
with my mistress; she was very exasperating in her language
to me, till I lost my temper, and said I could live in torment,
but I couldn’t live with her, and wished she would sell me.
She sent for an officer; and I said, ‘I am as willing to go
to jail as I am to take a drink of water.’ When the sheriff
saw me, he was very much surprised, and he said, ‘Why,
John, why are you here?’ I told him I had parted with my
temper, and said what no man ought to have said to a woman.
He said, ‘What a pity! such a name as your master gave you,
John!’ He interceded with my mistress, and the fourth day
she had me taken out. I told her I had acknowledged my
fault to my Maker, and I was willing to acknowledge it to
her. She said she was wrong too; and we agreed very well
after that. I was a very valuable servant to her. I could
whitewash, mend a fence, put in glass, use tools, serve up a
dinner, and then wait on it as gracefully as any man that ever
walked around a table. Then I would hitch up the carriage,
and drive her out. And I have never seen the day yet when
she has given me five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had always thought deeply on the subject of his condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I never felt at liberty to speak my mind until they
passed an act to put colored men into the army. That wrought
upon my feelings so I couldn’t but cry;” and the tears were
in his eyes again at the recollection. “They asked me if I
would fight for my country. I said, ‘I have no country.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>They said I should light for my freedom. I said, ‘To gain
my freedom, I must fight to keep my wife and children slaves.’
Then, after the war was over, they told us they had no more
use for niggers. I said I thought it hard, after they’d lived
by the sweat of our faces all our days, that now we must be
banished from the country, because we were free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke hopefully of his race. “If we can induce them
to be united, and to feel the responsibility that rests upon
them, they will get along very well. Many have bought
themselves, and paid every dollar to their masters, and then
been sold again, and been treated in this way till they have
no longer any confidence in the promises a white man makes
them. They won’t stay with their old masters on any terms.
Then there are some that expect to live without work. There
are some colored men, just as there are white men, that won’t
work to save their lives. Others won’t stay, for this reason:
The master takes their old daddy, and old mammy, and little
children, and casts them out on the forks of the road, and tells
them to go to the Court House, where the Yankees are, for
he don’t want ’em; then of course the young men and young
women go too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Early next morning, I went out to view the town. In size
and importance Petersburg ranks as the second city in the
State. In 1860 it had 18,275 inhabitants. It had fifty manufacturing
establishments in operation, employing three thousand
operatives, and consuming annually $2,000,000 worth
of raw material. Twenty factories manufactured yearly
12,000,000 pounds of tobacco. The falls of the Appomattox
afford an extensive water-power, and the river is navigable to
this place.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the city changed greatly from its old prosperous
condition. Its business was shattered. Its well-built, pleasant
streets, rising upon the south bank of the Appomattox, were
dirty and dilapidated. All the lower part of the town showed
the ruinous effect of the shelling it had received. Tenantless
and uninhabitable houses, with broken walls, roofless, or with
roofs smashed and torn by missiles, bear silent witness to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>havoc of war. In the ends of some buildings I counted more
than twenty shot-holes. Many battered houses had been repaired,—bright
spots of new bricks in the old walls showing
where projectiles had entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city was thronged by a superfluous black population
crowding in from the country. I talked with some, and tried
to persuade them to go back and remain at their old homes.
But they assured me that they could not remain: their very
lives had been in danger; and they told me of several murders
perpetrated upon freedmen by the whites, in their neighborhoods,
besides other atrocities. Yet it was evident many had
come to town in the vague hope of finding happy adventures
and bettering their condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember a gang of men, employed by the government,
waiting for orders, with their teams, on the sunny side of a
ruined street. Several, sitting on the ground, had spelling-books:
one was teaching another his letters; a third was reading
aloud to a wondering little audience; an old man, in spectacles,
with gray hair, was slowly and painfully spelling words
of two letters, which he followed closely with his heavy dark
finger along the sunlit page,—altogether a singular and affecting
sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having letters to General Gibbon commanding the military
district, I called on him at his head-quarters in a fine modern
Virginia mansion, and through his courtesy obtained a valuable
guide to the fortifications, in the person of Colonel E——,
of his staff.</p>

<p class='c000'>We drove out on the Jerusalem plank-road, leaving on our
right the reservoir, which Kautz’s cavalry in their dash at the
city mistook for a fort, and retired from with commendable
discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the plank-road, and striking across the open
country, we found, in the midst of weedy fields, the famous
“crater,”—scene of one of the most fearful tragedies of the
war. It was a huge irregular oblong pit, perhaps a hundred
feet in length and twenty in depth. From this spot, spouted
like a vast black fountain, from the earth, rose the garrison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and guns, and breastworks, of one of the strongest Rebel
forts, mined by our troops, and blown into the air on the
morning of July 30th, 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a deep ravine in front, up in the side of which
the mine had been worked. The mouth was still visible, half
hidden by rank weeds. In spots the surface earth had caved,
leaving chasms opening into the mine along its course. The
mouth of the Rebel counter-mine was also visible,—a deep,
dark, narrow cavern, supported by framework, in the lower
side of the crater. Lying around were relics of the battle,—bent
and rusted bayonets, canteens, and fragments of shells.
In front were the remains of wooden <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</span></i>, which
had been literally shot to pieces. And all around were
graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the earthworks near by I saw a negro man and woman
digging out bullets. They told me they got four cents a pound
for them in Petersburg. It was hard work, but they made a
living at it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding southward along the Confederate line of works, we
came to Fort Damnation, where the Rebels used to set up a
flag-staff for our boys to fire at with a six-pound Parrott gun,
making a wild sport of warfare. Opposite was Fort Hell,
built by our troops, and named in compliment to its profane
neighbor. The intrenched picket-lines between the two were
not more than seventy-five yards apart; each connected with
its fort by a covered way. These works were in an excellent
state of preservation. Fort Hell especially, constructed with
bomb-proofs and galleries which afforded the most ample protection
to its garrison, was in as perfect a condition as when
first completed. With a lighted torch I explored its magazine,
a Tartarean cave, with deep dark chambers, and walls covered
with a cold sweat.</p>

<p class='c000'>All along in front of the Rebel defences extended the
Federal breastworks, and it was interesting to trace the zigzag
lines by which our troops had, slowly and persistently, by
scientific steps, pushed their position ever nearer and nearer
to the enemy’s. Running round all, covered by an embankment,
was Grant’s army railroad.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Having driven southward along the Rebel lines to Fort
Damnation, and there crossed over to Fort Hell, we now
returned northward, riding along the Federal lines. A very
good corduroy road, built by our army, took us through deserted
villages of huts, where had been its recent winter-quarters;
past abandoned plantations and ruined dwellings;
over a plain which had been covered with forests before the war,
but where not a tree was now standing; and across the line
of the Norfolk Railroad, of which not a sleeper or rail remained.
We passed Fort Morton, confronting the “crater”;
and halted on a hill, in a pleasant little grove of broken and
dismantled oaks. Here were the earthworks and bomb-proofs
of Fort Stedman, the possession of which had cost more lives
than any other point along the lines, not excepting the
“crater.” Captured originally from the Rebels, retaken by
them, and recaptured by us, it was the subject of incessant
warfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Friend House, farther on, stationed on an eminence
overlooking Petersburg, was the celebrated “Petersburg Express,”—the
great gun which used to send its iron messengers
regularly into the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Friend Estate I saw, for the first time, evidences of
reviving agriculture in this war-blasted region. A good crop
of corn had been raised, and some five and thirty negro men
and women were beginning the harvest. There was no white
man about the place; but they told me they were working on
their own account for a portion of the crop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning to town by the City-Point Road, we set out again,
in the afternoon, to visit the more distant fortifications beyond
Forts Hell and Damnation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Driving out on the Boydton Plank Road to the Lead Works,
we there left it on our right, and proceeded along a sandy
track beside the Weldon Railroad where wagon-loads of North
Carolina cotton, laboring through the sand, attested that the
damage done to this railroad, in December of the previous
year, by Warren’s Corps,—which destroyed with conscientious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>thoroughness fifteen miles of the track,—had not yet
been repaired.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the Rebel forts, I was struck with the peculiar construction
of the Federal works. As we pushed farther and
farther our advanced lines around the city, they became so
extended that, to prevent raids on our rear, it was necessary
to construct rear lines of defence. Our intrenchments
accordingly took the form of a hook, doubled backward, and
terminating in something like a barbed point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cities of deserted huts, built in the midst of a vast level
plain, despoiled of its forests, showed where the winter-quarters
of our more advanced corps had been, during this last great
campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the winter-quarters of the Sixth Corps, we approached
one of the most beautiful villages that ever were seen.
It was sheltered by a grove of murmuring pines. An arched
gateway admitted us to its silent streets. It was constructed
entirely of pine saplings and logs. Even the neat sidewalks
were composed of the same material. The huts—if those
little dwellings, built in a unique and perfect style of architecture,
may be called by that humble name—were furnished
with bedrooms and mantel-pieces within, and plain columns
and fluted pilasters without, all of rough pine. The plain
columns were formed of single trunks, the fluted ones of
clusters of saplings,—all with the bark on, of course. The
walls were similarly constructed. The village was deserted,
with the exception of a safeguard, consisting of half a dozen
United States soldiers, stationed there to protect it from vandalism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gem of the place was the church. Its walls, pillars,
pointed arches, and spire, one hundred feet high, were composed
entirely of pines selected and arranged with surprising
taste and skill. The pulpit was in keeping with the rest.
Above it was the following inscription:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Presented to the members of the Poplar Spring Church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>by the 50th N. Y. V. Engineers. Capt. M. H. McGrath,
architect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Poplar Spring Church, which formerly stood somewhere
in that vicinity, had been destroyed during the war;
and this church had been left as a fitting legacy to its congregation
by the soldiers who built it. The village had been the
winter-quarters of the engineer corps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Driving westward along the track of the army railroad, and
past its termination, we struck across the open fields to the
Federal signal-tower, lifting skyward its lofty open framework
and dizzy platforms, in the midst of an extensive plain. To
ascend a few stages of this breezy observatory, and see the sun
go down behind the distant dim line of forests, while the
evening shadows thickened upon the landscape, was a fit
termination to the day’s experience; and we returned with
rapid wheels to the city.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>The next day I proceeded to City Point by railroad,—riding
in an old patched-up car marked outside “<em>U. S. Military
R. R.</em>,” and furnished inside with pine benches for seats and
boards nailed up in place of windows. There was nothing of
interest on the road, which passed through a region of stumps
and undergrowth, with scarce an inhabitant, save the few negro
families that had taken up their abode in abandoned army
huts. City Point itself was no less dull. Built on high and
rolling ground, at the confluence of the Appomattox and the
James,—a fine site for a village,—it had nothing to show
but an ugly cluster of rough wooden buildings, such as spring
up like fungus in the track of an army, and a long line of government
warehouses by the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took the first steamer for Richmond; returning thence, in
a few days, down the James to Norfolk and Fortress Monroe.
This voyage possesses an interest which can merely be hinted
at in a description. You are gliding between shores rich with
historical associations old and new. The mind goes back to
the time when Captain John Smith, with the expedition of
1607, sailed up this stream, which they named in honor of
their king. But you are diverted from those recollections by
the landmarks of recent famous events:—the ruins of ironclads
below Richmond; the wrecks of gun-boats; obstructions
in the channel; Fort Darling, on a high bluff; every commanding
eminence crowned by a redoubt; Dutch Gap Canal;
Deep Bottom; Butler’s tower of observation; Malvern Hill,
where the last battle of McClellan’s retreat was fought,—a gentle
elevation on the north bank, marked by a small house and
clumps of trees; Harrison’s Landing,—a long pier extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>out into the river; Jamestown, the first settlement in Virginia,—now
an island with a few huts only, and two or three
chimney-stacks of burnt houses,—looking as desolate as when
first destroyed, at the time of Bacon’s rebellion, near two
hundred years ago; Newport News below, a place with a few
shanties, and a row of grinning batteries; Hampton Roads,
bristling and animated with shipping,—the scene of the fight
between the “Merrimac” and the “Monitor,” initiating a
new era in naval warfare; Hampton away on the north, with
its conspicuous square white hospital; Norfolk on the south,
up the Elizabeth River; the Rip-Raps, and Sewall’s Point;
and, most astonishing object of all, that huge finger of the
military power, placed here to hold these shores,—Fortress
Monroe.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wild, windy day; the anchored ships were tossing
on the white-capped waves; but the Fortress presented a beautiful
calm picture, as we approached it, with its proud flag
careering in the breeze, its white light-house on the beach,
and the afternoon sunshine on its broad walls and grassy ramparts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the war, there was a large hotel between the Fortress
and the wharves, capable of accommodating a thousand persons.
This was torn down, because it obstructed the range
of the guns; and a miserable one-and-a-half story dining-saloon
had been erected in its place. Here, after much persuasion,
I managed to secure a lodging under the low, unfinished
roof. The proprietor told me that the government,
which owns the land on which his house stands, exacted no
payment for it, under General Dix’s administration; but that
General Butler, on coming into power, immediately clapped
on a smart rent of five hundred dollars a month, which the
landlord could pay, or take his house elsewhere. I thought
the circumstance characteristic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, having a letter to General Miles, in
command at the Fortress, I obtained admission within the
massy walls. I crossed the moat on the drawbridge, and
entered the gate opening under the heavy bastions. I found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>myself in the midst of a village, on a level plain, shaded by
trees. A guard was given me, with orders to show me whatever
I wished to see, with one exception,—the interior of Mr.
Jefferson Davis’s private residence. This retired Rebel chief
had been removed from the casemate in which he was originally
confined, and was occupying Carrol Hall, a plain, three-story,
yellow-painted building, built for officers’ quarters. I
walked past the doors, and looked up at the modest window-curtains,
wondering what his thoughts were, sitting there,
meditating his fallen fortunes, with the flag of the nation he
had attempted to overthrow floating above his head, and its
cannon frowning on the ramparts around him. Did he enjoy
his cigar, and read the morning newspaper with interest?</p>

<p class='c000'>The strength and vastness of Fortress Monroe astonishes
one. It is the most expensive fortress in the United States,
having cost nearly two and a half million-dollars. It is a mile
around the ramparts. The walls are fifty feet thick. The
stone masonry which forms their outward face rises twenty
feet above high-water mark in the moat; and the grassy parapets
are built ten feet higher. There were only seven hundred
men in the fort,—a small garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was shown the great magazine which Arnold, one of the
Booth conspirators, proposed to blow up. His plan was to get
a clerkship in the ordnance office, which would afford him
facilities for carrying out his scheme. Had this succeeded,
the terrible explosion that would have ensued would not only
have destroyed the Fortress, but not a building on the Point
would have been left standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>I made the circuit of the ramparts, overlooking Hampton
Roads on one side, and the broad bay on the other. The sun
was shining; the waves were breaking on the shore; the band
was playing proud martial airs; the nation’s flag rolled
voluptuously in the wind; steamers and white-sailed ships
were going and coming; the sky above was of deep blue, full
of peace. It was hard to realize that the immense structure
on which I walked, amid such a scene, was merely an engine
of war.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>While I was at General Miles’s head-quarters an interesting
case of pardoned rebellion was developed. Mr. Y——, a
noted secessionist of Warwick County, was one of those who
had early pledged his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor to
the Confederate cause. He had commenced his patriotic
service by seizing at his wharf on the Warwick River a private
vessel which happened to be loading with lumber at the
time when the State seceded, and sending her as a prize up
to Richmond; and he had crowned his career by assisting
Wirz in his official work at Andersonville. During the war
the government against which he was fighting had taken the
liberty of cutting a little lumber on this gentleman’s abandoned
lands. He had since become professedly loyal, paid a visit to
the good President at Washington, and returned to his estates
with his pardon in his pocket. The first thing he did was to
drive off the government contractor’s employees with threats
of violence. He would not even allow them to take away the
government property he found on his place, but threatened to
shoot every man who approached for that purpose. An officer
came to head-quarters, when I was there, requesting a guard
of soldiers to protect the lives of the laborers during the removal
of this property.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>ABOUT HAMPTON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As it was my intention to visit some of the freedmen’s
settlements in the vicinity, the General kindly placed a horse
at my disposal, and I took leave of him. A short gallop
brought me to the village of Hampton, distant from the Fortress
something over two miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The village of Hampton,” says a copy of the “Richmond
Examiner” for 1861, “is beautifully situated on an arm of the
sea setting in from the adjacent roadstead which bears its name.
The late census showed that the aggregate white and black
population was nearly two thousand.” Some of the residences
were of brick, erected at a heavy cost, and having large gardens,
out-houses, and other valuable improvements. The oldest
building, and the second oldest church in the State, was the
Episcopal Church, made of imported brick, and surrounded
by a cemetery of ancient graves. “Here repose the remains
of many a cavalier and gentleman, whose names are borne by
numerous families all over the Southern States.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the night of August 7th, 1861, the Rebels, under
General Magruder, initiated what has been termed the “warfare
against women and children and private property,” which
has marked the war of the Rebellion, by laying this old aristocratic
town in ashes. It had been mostly abandoned by the
secessionist inhabitants on its occupation by our troops, and
only a few white families, with between one and two hundred
negroes, remained. Many of the former residents came back
with the Rebel troops and set fire to their own and their
neighbors’ houses. Less than a dozen buildings remained
standing; the place being reduced to a wilderness of naked
chimneys, burnt-out shells, and heaps of ashes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>I found it a thrifty village, occupied chiefly by freedmen.
The former aristocratic residences had been replaced by negro
huts. These were very generally built of split boards, called
pales, overlapping each other like clapboards or shingles.
There was an air of neatness and comfort about them which
surprised me, no less than the rapidity with which they were
constructed. One man had just completed his house. He
told me that it took him a week to make the pales for it and
bring them from the woods, and four days more to build it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sash-factory and blacksmith’s shop, shoemakers’ shops
and stores, enlivened the streets. The business of the place
was carried on chiefly by freedmen, many of whom were
becoming wealthy, and paying heavy taxes to the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every house had its wood-pile, poultry and pigs, and little
garden devoted to corn and vegetables. Many a one had its
stable and cow, and horse and cart. The village was surrounded
by freedmen’s farms, occupying the abandoned plantations
of recent Rebels. The crops looked well, though the
soil was said to be poor. Indeed, this was by far the thriftiest
portion of Virginia I had seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In company with a gentleman who was in search of laborers,
I made an extensive tour of these farms, anxious to see with
my own eyes what the emancipated blacks were doing for
themselves. I found no idleness anywhere. Happiness and
industry were the universal rule. I conversed with many of
the people, and heard their simple stories. They had but one
trouble: the owners of the lands they occupied were coming
back with their pardons and demanding the restoration of
their estates. Here they had settled on abandoned Rebel
lands, under the direction of the government, and with the
government’s pledge, given through its officers, and secured
by act of Congress, that they should be protected in the use and
enjoyment of those lands for a term of three years, each freedman
occupying no more than forty acres, and paying an annual
rent to government not exceeding six per cent. of their value.
Here, under the shelter of that promise, they had built their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>little houses and established their humble homes. What was
to become of them? On one estate of six hundred acres
there was a thriving community of eight hundred freedmen.
The owner had been pardoned unconditionally by the President,
who, in his mercy to one class, seemed to forget what
justice was due to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms which some of these returning Rebels proposed
to the freedmen they found in possession of their lands, interested
me. One man, whose estate was worth sixteen
dollars an acre, offered to rent it to the families living on it for
eight dollars an acre, provided that the houses, which they
had themselves built, should revert to him at the end of the
year.</p>

<p class='c000'>My friend broke a bolt in his buggy, and we stopped at a
blacksmith-shop to get another. While the smith, a negro,
was making a new bolt, and fitting it neatly to its place, I
questioned him. He had a little lot of half an acre; upon
which he had built his own house and shop and shed. He had
a family, which he was supporting without any aid from the
government. He was doing very well until the owner of the
soil appeared, with the President’s pardon, and orders to have
his property restored to him. The land was worth twenty
dollars an acre. He told the blacksmith that he could remain
where he was, by paying twenty-four dollars a year rent for
his half acre. “I am going to leave,” said the poor man,
quietly, and without uttering a complaint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except on the government farm, where old and infirm persons
and orphan children were placed, I did not find anybody
who was receiving aid from the government. Said one, “I
have a family of seven children. Four are my own, and three
are my brother’s. I have twenty acres. I get no help from
government, and do not want any as long as I can have land.”
I stopped at another little farm-house, beside which was a
large pile of wood, and a still larger heap of unhusked corn,
two farm wagons, a market wagon, and a pair of mules. The
occupant of this place also had but twenty acres, and he was
“getting rich.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Has government helped you any this year?” I asked a
young fellow we met on the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Government</em> helped <em>me</em>?” he retorted proudly. “No; I
am helping government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We stopped at a little cobbler’s shop, the proprietor of
which was supporting not only his own wife and children, but
his aged mother and widowed sister. “Has government
helped you any?” we inquired. “Nary lick in the world!”
he replied, hammering away at his shoe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Driving across a farm, we saw an old negro without legs
hitching along on his stumps in a cornfield, pulling out grass
between the rows, and making it up into bundles to sell. He
hailed us, and wished to know if we wanted to buy any hay.
He seemed delighted when my companion told him he would
take all he had, at his own price. He said he froze his legs
one winter when he was a slave, and had to have them taken
off in consequence. Formerly he had received rations from
the government, but now he was earning his own support, except
what little he received from his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very common to hear of families that were helping
not only their own relatives, but others who had no such claim
of kindred upon them. And here I may add that the account
which these people gave of themselves was fully corroborated
by officers of the government and others who knew them.</p>

<p class='c000'>My friend did not succeed very well in obtaining laborers
for his mills. The height of the freedmen’s ambition was to
have little homes of their own and to work for themselves.
And who could blame this simple, strong instinct, since it was
not only pointing them the way of their own prosperity, but
serving also the needs of the country?<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the pending difficulty with the land-owners,
those who had had their lots assigned them were
going on to put up new houses, from which they might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>driven at any day,—so great was their faith in the honor of
the government which had already done so much for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Revisiting Virginia some months later, I learned that the
Freedmen’s Bureau had interposed to protect these people in
their rights, showing that their faith had not been in vain.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For example: the freedmen on the Jones Place, with one hundred and twenty
acres under cultivation, where they had commenced work with nothing for which
they did not have to run in debt, were now the owners of both stock and farming
implements; and, besides supporting their families, they were paying to the United
States a large annual rent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <span class='large'>A GENERAL VIEW OF VIRGINIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Called home from Fortress Monroe by an affair of business
requiring my attention, I resumed my Southern tour later in
the fall, passing through Central and South-western Virginia,
and returning from the Carolinas through Eastern Virginia in
the following February. I am warned by a want of space to
omit the details of these transient journeys, and to compress
my remaining notes on the State into as narrow a compass as
possible.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Virginia was long a synonym for beauty and fertility. In
the richness of her resources, she stood unrivalled among the
earlier States. In wealth and population, she led them all.
She was foremost also in political power; and the names she
gave to our Revolutionary history still sparkle as stars of the
first magnitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>This halo about her name has been slow to fade; although,
like a proud and indolent school-girl, once at the head of her
class, she has been making steady progress towards the foot.
Five of the original States have gone above her, and one by
one new-comers are fast overtaking her. Little Massachusetts
excels her in wealth, and Ohio in both wealth and population.</p>

<p class='c000'>The causes of this gradual falling back are other than physical
causes. Her natural advantages have not been overrated.
The Giver of good gifts has been munificent in his bounties
to her. She is rich in rivers, forests, mines, soils. That
broad avenue to the sea, the Chesapeake, and its affluents,
solicit commerce. Her supply of water-power is limitless and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>well distributed. She possesses a variety of climate, which is,
with few exceptions, healthful and delightful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fertility of the State is perhaps hardly equal to its fine
reputation, which, like that of some old authors, was acquired
in the freshness of her youth, and before her powerful young
competitors appeared to challenge the world’s attention. Such
reputations acquire a sanctity from age, which the spirit of
conservatism permits not to be questioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The State has many rich valleys, river bottoms, and alluvial
tracts bordering on lesser streams, which go far towards sustaining
this venerable reputation. But between these valleys
occur intervals of quite ordinary fertility, if not absolute sterility,
and these compose the larger portion of the State. Add
the fact that the best lands of Eastern and Southeastern Virginia
have been very generally worn out by improper cultivation,
and what is the conclusion?</p>

<p class='c000'>A striking feature of the country is its “old fields.” The
more recent of these are usually found covered with briers,
weeds, and broom-sedge,—often with a thick growth of infant
pines coming up like grass. Much of the land devastated
by the war lies in this condition. In two or three years, these
young pines shoot up their green plumes five or six feet high.
In ten years there is a young forest. In some of the oldest
of the old fields, now heavily timbered, the ridges of the ancient
tobacco lands are traceable among the trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tobacco has been the devouring enemy of the country. In
travelling through it one is amazed at the thought of the regions
which have been burned and chewed up by the smokers
and spitters of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>East Virginia is hilly. The southeast portion of the State
is undulating, with occasional plains, and swamps of formidable
extent. The soil of the tide-water districts is generally a light
sandy loam. A belt of mountain ranges, a hundred miles in
breadth, runs in a northeast and southwest direction across the
State, enclosing some of its richest and loveliest portions. The
Valley of Virginia,—as that fertile stripe is called lying west
of the Blue Ridge, drained by the Shenandoah and the head-waters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of the James,—is fitly called the granary of the State.
It is a limestone region, admirably adapted for grains and
grazing. The virginity of its soil has not been polluted by
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1860 there were in the State less than eleven and a half
million acres of improved land, out of an area of near forty
millions. Over thirteen million bushels of wheat were produced;
one million of rye, Indian corn, and oats; one hundred
and twenty-four million pounds of tobacco; twelve thousand
seven hundred and twenty-seven bales of cotton; and
two and a half million pounds of wool (in round numbers).
There were four thousand nine hundred manufacturing establishments,
the value of whose manufactures was fifty-one million
three hundred thousand dollars. There were thirteen cotton
factories, running twenty-eight thousand seven hundred spindles.
The most important article of export before the war
was negroes. There were sold out of the State annually
twenty thousand.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With the exception of the last-named staple, these annual
productions are destined to be multiplied indefinitely by a
vigorous system of free labor and the introduction of Northern
capital. The worn-out lands can be easily restored by the
application of marl and gypsum, with which the State abounds,
and of other natural fertilizers. The average value of land,
in 1850, was eight dollars an acre; while that of New Jersey,
which never bragged of its fertility, was forty-four dollars.
The former price will now buy lands in almost any section of
Virginia except the Shenandoah Valley; while there is no
question but that they can be raised to the latter price, and
beyond, in a very few years, by judicious cultivation, united
with such internal improvements as are indispensable to make
the wealth of any region available.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still greater inducements are presented to manufacturers than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to farmers. To large capitalists, looking to establish extensive
cotton-mills, I do not feel myself competent to offer any suggestions.
But of small manufactures I can speak with confidence.
Take the Shenandoah Valley for example. The wool
that is raised there is sent North to be manufactured, and
brought back in the shape of clothing, having incurred the
expense of transportation both ways, and paid the usual tariff
to traders through whose hands it has passed. The Valley
abounds in iron ore of the best quality; and it imports its
kettles and stoves. The same may be said of nearly all agricultural
implements. The freight on many of these imports
is equal to their original cost. It was said before the war that
scarce a wagon, clock, broom, boot, shoe, coat, rake or spade,
or piece of earthen ware, was used in the South, that was
not manufactured at the North; and the same is substantially
true to-day, notwithstanding the change in this particular
which the war was supposed to have effected. Let any enterprising
man, or company of men, with sufficient experience
for the work and capital to invest, go into Virginia, make use
of the natural water-power which is so copious that no special
price is put upon it, and manufacture, of the materials that
abound on the spot, articles that are in demand there, establishing
a judicious system of exchange, and who can doubt the
result, now that the great obstacle in the way of such undertakings,
slavery, has been removed?</p>

<p class='c000'>In speaking of the products of Virginia, we should not
forget its oysters; of which near fourteen and a half million
bushels, valued at four million eight hundred thousand dollars,
were sent from Chesapeake Bay in one year, previous to the
war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Virginia never had any common-school system. One third
of her adult population can neither read nor write. There
was a literary fund, established to promote the interests of
education, which amounted, in 1861, to something over two
millions of dollars; but it was swallowed by the war. At the
present time the prospect for white common schools in the
State is discouraging. The only one I heard of in anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>like a flourishing condition was a school for poor whites, established
by the Union Commission in the buildings of the Confederate
naval laboratory, at Richmond. It numbers five hundred
pupils, and is taught by experienced teachers from the
North. The prospect is better for the education of the freedmen.
There were in the State last winter ninety freedmen’s
schools, with an aggregate of eleven thousand five hundred
pupils. There were two hundred teachers; twenty-five of
whom were colored men and women at the head of self-supporting
schools of their own race. The remaining schools,
taught by experienced individuals from the North, were supported
mainly by the following benevolent associations: The
New-York National Freedmen’s Relief; American Missionary;
Pennsylvania Freedmen’s Relief; Baptist Home Mission;
New-England Freedmen’s Aid; and Philadelphia
Friends’ Freedmen’s Relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opposition manifested by a large class of whites to the
establishment of these schools was at first intense and bitter.
It had nearly ceased,—together with the outrages on freedmen,
which had been frequent,—when, on the removal of
the troops from certain localities,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> it recommenced, and was, at
my last visit, fearfully on the increase. Teachers were threatened
and insulted, and school-houses broken into or burned.
The better class of citizens,—many of whom see the necessity
of educating the negro now that he is free,—while they
have nothing to do with these acts of barbarism, are powerless
to prevent them. The negro-haters are so strong an element
in every society that they completely shield the wrong-doers
from the reach of civil law.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great subject of discussion among the people everywhere
was the “niggers.” Only a minority of the more enlightened
class, out of their large hearts and clear heads, spoke
of them kindly and dispassionately. The mass of the people,
including alike the well-educated and the illiterate, generally
detested the negroes, and wished every one of them driven
out of the State. The black man was well enough as a slave;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>but even those who rejoiced that slavery was no more, desired
to get rid of him along with it. When he was a chattel, like
a horse or dog, he was commonly cherished, and sometimes
even loved like a favorite horse or dog, and there was not a
particle of prejudice against him on account of color; but the
master-race could not forgive him for being free; and that he
should assume to be a man, self-owning and self-directing, was
intolerable. I simply state the fact; I do not condemn anybody.
That such a feeling should exist is, I know, the most
natural thing in the world; and I make all allowances for
habit and education.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is this feeling which makes some protection on the part
of the government necessary to the negro in his new condition.
The Freedmen’s Bureau stands as a mediator between
him and the race from whose absolute control he has been too
recently emancipated to expect from it absolute justice. The
belief inheres in the minds of the late masters, that they have
still a right to appropriate his labor. Although we may acquit
them of intentional wrong, it is impossible not to see how far
their conduct is from right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the war, it was customary to pay for ordinary able-bodied
plantation slaves, hired of their masters, at rates varying
from one hundred and ten to one hundred and forty dollars
a year for each man, together with food, clothing, and medical
attendance. After the war, the farmers in many counties of
Virginia entered into combinations, pledging themselves to
pay the freed slave only sixty dollars a year, exclusive of
clothing and medical attendance, with which he was to furnish
himself out of such meagre wages. They also engaged
not to hire any freedman who had left a former employer
without his consent. These were private leagues instituting
measures similar to those which South Carolina and some other
States afterwards enacted as laws, and having in view the same
end, namely,—to hold the negro in the condition of abject dependence
from which he was thought to have been emancipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the freedman’s supposed unwillingness to work, and
the employer’s poverty occasioned by the war, were not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>reasons why he was to be paid less than half the wages he
earned when hired out as a slave, I had abundant evidence.
One illustration will suffice. Visiting the tobacco factories
of Richmond, I found them worked entirely by freedmen
under white superintendents. I never saw more rapid labor
performed with hands than the doing up of the tobacco in rolls
for the presses; nor harder labor with the muscles of the
whole body than the working of the presses. The superintendents
told me they had difficulty in procuring operatives.
I inquired if the freedmen were well paid; and was informed
that good workmen earned a dollar and a half a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the negroes will not engage in the business, why not
employ white labor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We tried that years ago, and it wouldn’t answer. White
men can’t stand it; they can’t do the work. This press-work
is a dead strain; only the strongest niggers are up to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Those putting up the tobacco in rolls,—three ounces in
each, though they rarely stopped to place one on the scales,—showed
a skill which could have resulted only from years
of practice. I learned, from conversing with them, that they
were dissatisfied with their pay; and the superintendents admitted
that, while the negroes worked as well as ever, labor
was much cheaper than formerly. On further investigation
I ascertained that a combination between the manufacturers
kept the wages down, that each workman had to employ a
“stemmer,” who made the tobacco ready for his hands; and
that his earnings were thus reduced to less than five dollars a
week, out of which he had himself and his family to support.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>The Bureau labored to break up these combinations, and to
secure for the freedmen all the rights of freemen. Colonel
Brown, the Assistant-Commissioner for Virginia, divided the
State into districts, and assigned a superintendent to each.
The districts were subdivided into sub-districts, for which
assistant superintendents were appointed. Thus the Bureau’s
influence was felt more or less throughout the State. It assisted
the freedmen in obtaining employment, regulated contracts,
and secured to them fair wages. It had a general
superintendence of freedmen’s schools. It used such powers
as it possessed to scatter the negroes, whom the exigencies of
the war had collected together in great numbers at places
where but few could hope for employment. It fed the destitute,
the aged, the orphan, the infirm, and such as were
unable to find work,—who, in that period of transition, must
have perished in masses without such aid. It likewise established
courts for the trial of minor cases of litigation or crime
in which persons of color were concerned. Each court was
originally presided over by an officer of the Bureau; but in
order to secure impartial justice to all, there were associated
with him two agents, one chosen by the citizens of the sub-district
in which it was located, and the other by the freedmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is in every community a certain percentage of its
members that look to get a living without honest toil. I am
not aware that the negro has any more love for work than
another man. Coming into the enjoyment of freedom before
they knew what freedom meant, no wonder that many should
have regarded life henceforth as a Christmas frolic. The system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>which had held them in bondage had kept them ignorant.
Having always been provided for by their masters, they were
as improvident as children. They believed that the government
which had been their Liberator would likewise be their
Provider: the lands of their Rebel masters were to be given
them, and their future was to be licensed and joyous. They
had the vices of a degraded and enslaved race. They would
lie and steal and shirk their tasks. Their pleasures were of
a sensuous character; even their religion was sensuous; the
sanctity of the marriage-tie, so long subject to the caprices
of the master-race, was lightly esteemed. Under these circumstances
the proportion of those who have shown a persistent
determination to lead lives of vice and vagrancy,
appears to me surprisingly small. Their number still decreases
as their enlightenment increases. The efforts of the
Freedmen’s Bureau, and Northern missionary and educational
labors among them, have contributed greatly towards
this desirable result. Still more might be done if additional
discretionary powers were granted the Assistant-Commissioner.
Vagrants, whether white or black, should be treated
as vagrants; and I thought it would have been a wholesome
measure for the Bureau to make contracts for those freedmen
who refused to make contracts for themselves, and were without
any visible means of support.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are in Virginia half a million negroes. Those appear
most thriving and happy who are at work for themselves. I
have described the freedmen’s farms about Hampton. In
other portions of Southeast Virginia, where the Federal influence
has been longest felt, they are equally industrious and
prosperous. Captain Flagg, the superintendent at Norfolk,
whose district comprises seven counties, told me that he was
not issuing rations to a hundred persons, besides orphan children.
In Northampton and Accomack counties every negro
owns his boat, and earns with it three dollars a day at oystering,
in the oyster season. There are perhaps eighteen thousand
freedmen in those counties, all engaged in oystering,
fishing, and the cultivation of lands which they own or hire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>In Norfolk, Princess Anne, and other counties adjacent,
planters were very generally renting or selling lands to the
freedmen, who were rapidly becoming a respectable, solid, tax-paying
class of people. Many colored soldiers were coming
back and buying small farms with money earned in the service
of the government. Captain Flagg, a man of sense and discretion,
said to me deliberately, and gave me leave to publish
the statement:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe the negro population of the seven counties of my
district will compare favorably, in respect to industry and
thrift, with any laboring white population of similar resources
at the North.” Adding, “I believe most thoroughly in the
ability of these people to get a living even where a white man
would starve.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen in other parts of the State were not doing as
well, being obliged generally to enter into contracts with the
land-owners. Many of these, impoverished by the war, could
not afford to pay them more than seven or eight dollars a
month for their labor; while some were not able to pay even
that. Their fences destroyed, buildings burned, farming implements
worn out, horses, mules, and other stock consumed
by both armies, investments in Confederate bonds worthless,
bank-stock gone, without money, or anything to exchange for
money, they had often only their bare lands on which to commence
life anew; and could not therefore give much encouragement
to the freedman, whatever may have been their disposition
towards him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The legislative and local affairs of the State had very generally
fallen under the influence, or into the hands, of those
who had given aid and sympathy to the Rebellion. Indeed,
Governor Pierpoint told me that there were not unquestionably
loyal men enough in Virginia to form a government. “In
many counties,” said he, “you will not find one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Virginia sent to the convention of February 13th, 1861,
a majority of Union delegates. It was only after the fall of
Fort Sumter, and President Lincoln’s call for troops, that a
vote could be had taking the State out of the Union. Eighty-eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>delegates voted for the ordinance of secession, fifty-five
against it. It was afterwards—in the tempest of excitement
which swept over the State—adopted by the people by a majority
of ninety-four thousand. It was an act of passion and
madness. Travelling through the State, I found a majority of
the people professing to have been at heart Union men all the
while. They could never forgive South Carolina for the evil
course in which she had led them; and it was very common
to hear the wish expressed, “that South Carolina and Massachusetts
were kicked out into the Atlantic together.” Having,
however, against her better reason, seceded, Virginia became
the most devoted and self-sacrificing of all the States in the
cause in which she had embarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroads of the State<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> were, both financially and physically,
in a bad condition. They had been used excessively
during the war, and stood in need of repairs. The iron taken
from the Richmond and York River Road had not been replaced.
The time made by trains was necessarily slow. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>rolling-stock was limited, and generally in a worse condition
than the roads. But few lines were paying anything more
than the expenses of running them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old State banks went down with the Confederacy. The
circulation of the new National Banks in the State did not, in
January 1866, exceed $1,300,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was necessarily a great scarcity of money. It was
difficult to raise funds even on the mortgage of real estate. The
existence of usury laws, limiting the rate of interest at six
per cent., operated to shut out Northern capital, which could
find investments nearer home at more remunerative rates.
When I was last in Richmond there was pending in the legislature
a bill for the repeal of those laws, which, however, did
not pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>The immediate prospects of Virginia are dismal enough.
But beyond this morning darkness I see the new sun rising.
The great barrier, slavery, removed, all the lesser barriers to
her prosperity must give way. The current of emigration,
of education, of progressive ideas, is surely setting in; and in
a few years we shall see this beautiful torpid body rise up,
renewed with health and strength, a glory to herself and to
the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richmond September 18, 1865 Dear Sirs We the Tobacco mechanicks of this city
and Manchester is worked to great disadvantage In 1858 and 1859 our masters hired
us to the Tobacconist at a prices ranging from $150 to 180. The Tobacconist furnished
us lodging food &amp; clothing. They gave us tasks to performe, all we made
over this task they payed us for. We worked faithful and they paid us faithful. They
Then gave us $2 to 2.50 cts, and we made double the amount we now make. The
Tobacconist held a meeting, and resolved not give more than $1.50 cts per hundred,
which is about one days work—in a week we may make 600 lbs apece with a stemer.
The weeks work then at $1.50 amounts to $9—the stemers wages is from $4 to $4.50
cts which leaves from $5 to 4–50 cts per week about one half what we made when
slaves. Now to Rent two small rooms we have to pay from $18 to 20. We see
$4 50 cts or $5 will not more then pay Rent say nothing about food Clothing medicin
Doctor Bills, Tax and Co. They say we will starve through lazines that is
not so. But it is true we will starve at our present wages. They say we will steal
we can say for ourselves we had rather work for our living, give us a Chance.
We are Compeled to work for them at low wages and pay high Rents and make $5
per week and sometimes les. And paying $18 or 20 per month Rent. It is impossible
to feed ourselves and family—starvation is Cirten unles a change is brought

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1860, there were in Virginia $66,000,000 of capital invested in 1675 miles of
railroad, distributed over sixteen lines. This estimate includes 287 miles of the Baltimore
and Ohio Road. In all the important roads except this, the State is a principal
shareholder. The management of some of them has always been loose and uneconomical.</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Pierpoint wisely recommends a consolidation of certain lines:—“On the
south side of James River we have the Norfolk and Petersburg, South-Side, Virginia
and Tennessee, and the Richmond and Danville railroads. These roads are under
the management of four different corps of officers, employed at remunerative salaries.
Three of these roads form a continuous line of about four hundred miles, and all three
of them afford business for the fourth. By working these roads separately a car is
loaded at Norfolk with freight for Danville or Abingdon; it is brought to Petersburg
to the South-Side Road, and there transferred from the Norfolk to a South-Side car;
thence it is taken to Burkeville, where it is again transferred to a Danville car,—if
its destination is to that town,—or taken to Lynchburg and reshipped on the Virginia
and Tennessee Road, if it goes to Abingdon. In these transactions the cars are
delayed, thereby causing a much larger investment in rolling-stock to accommodate
the business of these roads, in addition to the labor required to load and unload the
freight, besides exposing the merchandise to loss and delaying its transportation.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, with the Northwestern Virginia and Washington
branches, is nearly as long as the four roads above named, and the gross earnings of
that railroad is about three times as great, the charges for passengers and freight being
thirty-three per cent. less than on the Virginia roads referred to; yet the whole business
of the Baltimore and Ohio road is done by one corps of officers with moderate
salaries. There is the same reason for consolidating the Orange and Alexandria and
Virginia Central Roads.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE “SWITZERLAND OF AMERICA.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>From the grassy hills and vales of Southwest Virginia, I
passed over by railroad into East Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first sight, the “Switzerland of America” is apt, I think,
to disappoint one. It is a country of pleasant hills, bounded
and broken into by mountains which do not remind you of the
Alps. The cottages of the inhabitants lack the picturesque
element. A few first-class farmers have comfortable-looking
painted or brick houses; while scattered everywhere over the
country are poverty-stricken, weather-blackened little framed
dwellings and log-huts. Many of these are without windows;
the inmates living by the daylight let in through doors, and
the firelight from open chimneys. Good barns are rare.
The common class of villages are without sidewalks or paved
streets. In the rainy season they are wretched. They look
like Northern villages that have set out to travel and got stuck
in the mud. One or two are noteworthy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenville, the county seat of Greene County, is chiefly interesting
as being the home of the President. It stands on
broken ground, and is surrounded by a fine hilly country
shaded by oaken groves. The town, as I saw it one wet
morning, was eminently disagreeable. The mud came up to
the very doors of its old, dilapidated, unpainted wooden
houses. Its more pretentious, white-painted and brick dwellings
were not quite so deep in the mire. A hundred chimney
smokes draped the brown irregular roofs. President Johnson’s
house is on Main Street; a commonplace, respectable brick
dwelling. The Rebels smashed the windows for him in wartimes,
but they have been replaced, and the house is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>occupied by the county sheriff. Every man knows “Andy
Johnson.” He has a good reputation for honesty, but I was
told he was “hard on money matters.” A prominent citizen
who knew him intimately, said to me, “Johnson is a man
of much greater ability than he has ever had credit for.
When he was a tailor, he did his work well,—always a good
honest job. He has many good traits, and a few bad ones.
He is surly and vindictive, and a man of strong prejudices,
but thoroughly a patriot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is in Greenville a spring which bursts out of a hill-side
in sufficient volume to carry a mill. The country abounds
in springs, some of a curious character. In Johnson County,
in the mountainous northeast corner of the State, there is a
subterranean reservoir of water, out of which issue in the
night-time, during the spring months, numbers of small black
perch, of a blind species, which are caught in traps at the
mouth of the spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knoxville, (named in honor of Revolutionary General
Knox,) the most considerable town of East Tennessee, is situated
on abrupt hills, on the north bank of the Holston River,
which is navigable by steamers to this point. Here is the junction
of the East Tennessee and Virginia, and East Tennessee
and Georgia railroads. The city has something more than
eight thousand inhabitants. It was formerly the capital of the
State. It is surrounded by fortified hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place received rough treatment during the war. The
Bell House, at which I stopped, was a miserable shell, carpetless
and dilapidated, full of broken windows. The landlord
apologized for not putting it into repair. “I don’t know how
long I shall stop here. Hotel-keeping a’n’t my business.
Nigger-dealing is my business. But that’s played out. I’ve
bought and sold in my day over six hundred niggers,”—spoken
with mournful satisfaction, mingled pride and regret.
“Now I don’t know what I shall turn my hand to. I’m
a Georgian; I came up here from Atlanta time it was
burned.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the table of the Bell House, a Southern gentleman who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>sat next me called out to one of the waiters, a good-looking
colored man, perhaps thirty years of age,—“Here, boy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My name is Dick,” said the “boy,” respectfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll answer to the name I call you, or I’ll blow a hole
through you!” swore the Southern gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick made no reply, but went about his business. The
Southern gentleman proceeded, addressing the company:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Last week, in Chattanooga, I said to a nigger I found at
the railroad, ‘Here, Buck! show me the baggage-room.’ He
said, ‘My name a’n’t Buck.’ I just put my six-shooter to his
head, and, by ——! he didn’t stop to think what his name
was, but showed me what I wanted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This gentlemanly way of dealing with the “d——d impudent
niggers” was warmly applauded by all the guests at
the table, except one, who did not see the impudence; showing
that they were gentlemen of a similar spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were a great many freedmen crowded into Knoxville
from Georgia and the Carolinas, whence they had escaped
during the war. The police were arresting and sending them
back. East Tennesseeans, though opposed to slavery and
secession, do not like niggers. There is at this day more prejudice
against color among the middle and poorer classes—the
“Union” men, of the South, who owned few or no slaves—than
among the planters who owned them by scores and hundreds.
There was a freedmen’s school-house burned in Knoxville,
while I was in that part of the State; and on reaching
Nashville, I learned that the negro testimony bill had been
defeated in the legislature by the members from East Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>East Tennessee, owning but a handful of slaves, and having
little interest in slavery, opposed secession by overwhelming
majorities. She opposed the holding of a convention, at the
election of February, 1861, by a vote of 30,903 against
5,577; and, at the election in June following, opposed the
ordinance of separation submitted to the people by the legislature,
by 32,923 votes against 14,780. The secession element
proved a bitter and violent minority. Neighborhood feuds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>ensued, of a fierce political and personal character. When the
Confederate army came in, the secessionists pointed out their
Union neighbors, and caused them to be robbed and maltreated.
They exposed the retreats of hunted conscripts lying
out in forests and caves, and assisted in the pursuit of loyal
refugees. When the National forces possessed the country,
the Union men retaliated. It was then the persecutor’s turn
to be stripped of his property and driven from his home.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was sorry to find the fires of these old feuds still burning.
The State Government was in the hands of Union men, and
Rebels and refugees from the Union army were disfranchised.
Secessionists, who assisted at the hanging and robbing of Union
men, and burned their houses, were receiving just punishment
for their crimes in the civil courts and at the hands of the sheriff.
This was well; and it should have been enough. But those
who had suffered so long and so cruelly at the hands of their
enemies did not think so. Returning Rebels were mobbed;
and if one had stolen back unawares to his home, it was not
safe for him to remain there. I saw in Virginia one of these
exiles, who told me how homesickly he pined for the hills and
meadows of East Tennessee, which he thought the most delightful
region in the world. But there was a rope hanging
from a tree for him there, and he dared not go back. “The
bottom rails are on top,” said he: “that is the trouble.” The
Union element, and the worst part of the Union element, was
uppermost. There was some truth in this statement. It was
not the respectable farming class, but the roughs, who kept the
old fires blazing. Many secessionists and Union men, who
had been neighbors before the war, were living side by side
again, in as friendly relations as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Strawberry Plain, on the Holston River, I saw a manifestation
of this partisan spirit. A laboring man, whom I met
on the butment of the burned railroad bridge, was telling me
about the Rebel operations at that place, when a fine fellow
came dashing into the village on horseback.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a dog-goned Rebel now!” said my man, eyeing
him with baleful glances. “He’s a rebel colonel, just come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>back. He’ll get warned; and then if he don’t leave, he must
look out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I think if the “dog-goned Rebel” had seen what I saw, in
the deadly determination of the man, he would have needed
no further warning.</p>

<p class='c000'>I listened to many tales of persecution and suffering endured
by loyal East Tennesseeans during the war. Here is the outline
of one, related to me by a farmer in Greene County.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After the Rebel Conscript Act passed, I started with my
son and a hundred other refugees to go over the mountains
into Kentucky. The Rebels pursued us, put on the track by
some of our secesh neighbors. Some escaped, my son with
them; but I was taken, and brought back with irons on my
wrists. That was the twenty-fifth of July, 1863. I was carried
to Richmond, and kept in Castle Thunder till the twentieth
of October. They then put me on a train to take me
to Salisbury prison, in North Carolina. I was in a box car,
and I found that a board at one corner of it was so loose that
I could pull it off with my hands. Just at night, when we
were about eighteen miles from Salisbury, and the train was
running about ten miles an hour, I pulled away the board, and
jumped off. I took to the fields, and tramped till I came to
the Yadkin River, where a nigger took me over in his canoe.
I tramped all night, and lay by the next day in the woods, and
tramped again the next night, and lay by again the next day,
and so on for fourteen nights and days; in which time I travelled
three hundred miles. They were moonlight nights, and
I got along very well, only I near-about starved. I lived on
raw corn and pumpkins. I kept the line of the Western Railroad;
I flanked the depots and pickets, but I was several times
nigh being caught. I never entered a house, or passed near
one, if I could help it. It was a hard, long, lonesome tramp.
I did not speak to a human being, except the nigger that took
me across the Yadkin, and another I almost run over on the
road as I was coming to Asheville. He said to me, ‘Good
evening.’ I muttered back something, and went on. I hadn’t
gone far before I changed my mind. Something said to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>‘Ask help of that nigger.’ I was sick and worn out, and
almost perishing for want of food. Besides, I did not know
the country; I saw I was coming to a town, and there was
danger I might be taken. I went back, and said to the nigger,
‘Can you give me something to eat?’ He was sitting on the
ground; but he jumped up, and looked at me by the moonlight,
and said, ‘Where do you want to go?’ I told him.
Then he knew I was a Union man running away from the
Rebels. He told me to wait for him there, and came back in
a little while with a heap of bread and beef. Never anything
tasted so good. After I had eaten, he gave me directions
how to avoid the guard, and strike the road beyond Asheville.
I came over the mountains, and reached here the fourteenth
night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>East Tennessee contributed a liberal quota to the national
army. Twenty-five thousand loyal refugees escaped into Kentucky,
and fought their way back again with Burnside’s forces
in 1863.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>EAST TENNESSEE FARMERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I found the East Tennesseeans a plain, honest, industrious,
old-fashioned people. Only about four out of five can read
and write. Men of the North and West would consider them
slow. They are dressed, almost without exception, in coarse,
strong “domestic,” as the home-manufactured cloth of the
country is called. It is woven on hand-looms, which are to
be found in nearly every farm-house. Domestic is, in fact,
an institution, not of Tennessee alone, but of the entire Southern
country. In the absence of manufacturing establishments,
the interest in this primitive private industry has not been
suffered to decline. It stood the South in good stead during
the war. After the importation of goods was cut off, it clothed
the people. All classes wore it. Even at the time of my visit,
I found many proprietors of large estates, the aristocrats of
the country, wearing garments which had been spun, colored,
and woven by their own slaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tennessee has no system of free schools. There was a
common-school fund, derived mainly from public lands given
for the purpose by the United States. The State was the
trustee of this fund, which the Constitution declared “permanent,
never to be diminished by legislative appropriation,” nor
“devoted to any other use than the support and encouragement
of common schools.” The proceeds of this fund distributed
among the schools in 1859, amounted to $230,430,
or seventy-five cents for each scholar in the State. Treason,
which betrayed so many sacred trusts, betrayed this. According
to Governor Brownlow “a more perfidious act than the
appropriation of this fund to treasonable purposes was not
committed during the late perfidious rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The people of East Tennessee took more interest, perhaps,
in common-school education, than the inhabitants of other parts
of the State; but that was not much. The school-fund went
but a little way toward the support of schools. There were
scattered throughout the country log school-houses capable of
accommodating fifty pupils each. The tuition varied from two
dollars and a half to three dollars a scholar. The teachers
were supported by neighborhood subscriptions. But education
was regarded by the poor as a luxury which they could not
afford; and even the middling class was apt to consider their
money and their children’s labor of more importance than
book-learning. The war, and the waste of the school-fund,
had for four years put an end to schools, and I found the new
generation growing up in ignorance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The school-houses serve as meeting-houses. There are few
churches beside. Outside of the larger towns, scarce a spire
points its finger towards heaven. This is true not only of
Tennessee, but of the whole South. It is one of the peculiarities
of the country which strike the Northern traveller unpleasantly.
The village green, with the neat white-steepled edifice
standing upon it, distinguishable from all other buildings, is no
feature of the Southern landscape. You may travel thousands
of miles and not meet with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the East Tennesseeans are a church-going people. No
especial form of meeting-house, any more than form of worship,
is necessary to the exercise of that divine faculty by
which man communes with his Maker. The Holy Spirit
enters as readily the log-hut, where two or three are gathered
together, as the great temples where multitudes assemble.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Methodist Church predominates in East Tennessee.
The United Brethren, who admit to their communion no rum-seller,
rum-drinker, nor slaveholder, have a powerful influence.
They were much persecuted in the South before the
war, as was natural in a country where the prejudice in favor
of rum and slavery was so strong; but of late, in East Tennessee,
they have grown in strength and popularity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Farming is behind the age. Mowers and reapers, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>might be employed to fine advantage on the beautiful smooth
meadows and grain-fields of East Tennessee, have scarcely
come into use at all. In Greene County I heard of but three.
Manures are wasted. It is customary to rotate crops, until
even rotation must cease, giving place to a usurpation of weeds
and broom-sedge. A favorite method of improving land is to
“clover” it; that is, to plough in crops of clover and grass.
Farming utensils are nearly all brought from the North; and
there is a great need for home manufactures here also. The
farmers generally work mules and mares. The mares are kept
chiefly for breeding mules. For which purpose likewise every
neighborhood, if not every farm, has its “jack.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The further my observations extended, the more strongly I
was convinced that mules were an indispensable substitute for
horses in the South. Animals there do not receive the cherishing
care they get at the North; and the rough, careless treatment
which I saw almost universally shown to beasts of
burden, not only by the negroes, but also by the whites, can be
endured by nothing less hardy than the mule. This valuable
creature, besides possessing the advantages I have elsewhere
alluded to, is recommended for his brave appetite, which slights
no part of the product of a hill of corn, but sturdily masters
stalk, cob, and shucks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Animals are driven, both at ploughing and teaming, by one
rein, which is attached to the middle of the bridle-rein on the
neck of the “lead” horse or mule, as the “near” or left-hand
beast is called. The driver gives two little jerks for <em>gee</em>, and
a steady pull for <em>haw</em>. This is the custom throughout the
South.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found horses cheap in Tennessee. A farmer said to me,
“A hundred and a half will buy our best animal. This is not
because horses are plenty, but because money is scarce. Formerly
we used to take large droves of our stock to Georgia
and the Carolinas; but that market is closed now, there is no
money there.” Several weeks afterwards, in one of the middle
counties of South Carolina, I met this very man, who told me
he had come into the State with eleven horses, and sold them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>all at good prices. There had been more money hoarded, and
more cotton reserved to be exchanged for money, in parts of
the South than was at first supposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tennessee and Kentucky are the two great mule-breeding
States. East Tennessee takes first rank among the grazing
sections of the South and West. Wild grass abounds in the
uncultivated districts. Interminable forests on the mountain
sides are carpeted with it. The woods are kept open and free
from undergrowth by fires; and this native grass springs up
and covers the ground. The mountains are full of deer which
feed upon it. Many a beautiful range of thousands of acres is
also afforded the farmers’ stock, which is sent in vast numbers
to occupy this wild, free, unfenced pasturage. Neighbors club
together to make up a herd of four or five hundred head of
cattle, enough to render profitable the employment of a herdsman.
Farmers have but little hay to provide for the winter
season. The climate is such that there is no month in the
year during which cattle cannot gain at least a partial subsistence
by grazing. This I account one of the great advantages
of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the great disadvantages is the want of a market. I
saw a farmer in Jefferson County who had five thousand
bushels of corn, for which he could find no sale near home;
and the cost of transportation was too great to think of taking
it out of the State. Said he, “We find it for our interest to
feed our farm-produce into stock, and drive it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was told there was “a heap of thin, poor soil in East
Tennessee.” The ordinary land produces fifteen bushels of
wheat, and thirty-five of corn to the acre. The lands on the
river bottoms are incomparably better. Prices range from
eight and ten to eighty and a hundred dollars per acre, according
to the situation and quality. There are farms to be had
in every section; it can scarcely be said that they are for sale,
there being no sale for them. Such is the distress for money
among holders of real estate, that land can be had in some of
the most desirable locations almost at the buyer’s own price.
It is claimed that before the war the wheat of East Tennessee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>commanded the highest market-prices in Richmond and New
York, as having that fine, enduring quality wheat derives only
from good limestone soils. Fruits abound,—apples, peaches,
pears, plums; and both climate and soil are admirably adapted
to the grape. The country is well watered, and its climate is
mild and salubrious. Manufacturing facilities are abundant.
There are forests and coal-mines, lead, zinc, iron, copper,
marble, and unimproved water-power to any extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Farmers told me they were paying the freedmen from eight
to fifteen dollars a month, and boarding them. They said,
“We can afford to pay more than Virginians can, because we
farm it better.” They laughed at the Virginians’ shiftless
methods. Yet a few were beginning to learn that even they
were not perfect in the business. One who had visited Iowa,
where he saw men plough out two rows of corn at a time, and
mow and reap with machinery, one hand doing the work of
four or five men, said he had concluded that they in Tennessee
didn’t know anything.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>IN AND ABOUT CHATTANOOGA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Two hundred and fifty miles from Knoxville, lying within
a coil of the serpentine Tennessee, on its south bank, surrounded
by mountains, is the town of Chattanooga. Here
the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad connects with the
Nashville and Chattanooga, and with the Western and Atlantic,
making the place an important centre of railroad communications.
The river is navigable for steamboats during eight
months of the year. Here are shipped the principal exports
of East Tennessee and of Southern Middle Tennessee. Hence
the military importance of the place, and its historical interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although embosomed amid strikingly bold and grand scenery,
Chattanooga is anything but a lovely town. On the
east, but a few miles distant, is Missionary Ridge,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> a range of
forest-covered mountains rising from the river and sweeping
away southward into Georgia. On the southwest is Lookout
Mountain, with rugged, precipitous front overlooking the river
and the town. Between this mountain and Missionary Ridge
lies Chattanooga Valley. Rising steeply from the edge of the
town, within the curve of the river which encloses it on the
north and west, is Cameron Hill, a sort of miniature copy of
Lookout. A miniature only by comparison; for it is a little
mountain by itself: a peaked bluff, its summit flanked by
forts, and crowned by a battery of a single huge gun.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
<img src='images/i_249.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>If you visit Chattanooga, climb, as I did, this hill the first
fair morning after your arrival. Away on the south are the
mountains of Georgia; on the north, those of Tennessee.
Dividing these peaks and ranges with its shining cimeter,
curves the river, overhung by precipitous crags. Far beneath
you, as you look from the northern brow of the hill, ply the
steamboats, breaking the surface into streaks of foam, and puffing
white wreaths up into the clear, still air. Opposite, across
the river, are clusters of high, wooded hills, with signal-stations
on their peaks.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the valley at the foot of Cameron, is Chattanooga, with
its multitude of long, low, whitewashed wooden buildings,
government storehouses, barracks, shops, rows of huts, and
corrals, such as make haste always to spring up around an
army’s base of supplies. Surrounding the town are red earthworks,
and hills of red earth with devious roads and paths
winding over them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found a strangely mixed population in Chattanooga,—traders,
adventurers, soldiers, poor whites, refugees, and negroes.
There were many Union men from the Cotton States,
who had escaped into our lines during the war, and either
could not or dared not return. Here is a sample of them,—a
lank, sallow, ragged individual with long black hair and wild
beard, whose acquaintance I made in the streets. He was a
shoemaker from Georgia. His Rebel neighbors had burned
his house and shop, destroyed his tools, and forced him to flee
for his life. He enlisted in our army, and had been fighting
his daddy and two brothers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My daddy,” said he, “is as good a Rebel as you’ll find.
He has grieved himself nigh-about to death because he didn’t
gain his independence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked him how his father would receive him if he should
go back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I allow we shouldn’t git along together no hack! The
first question I’d ask him would be if he’d tuck the oath of
allegiance. That would devil him to death. Then I’d ask
him if he knowed whar his President Jeff was. Then he’d
jest let in to cussin’ me. But I can’t go back. The men that
robbed me are jest as bad Rebels as ever, and they’d burn my
house again, or give me a bullet from behind some bush.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>There was in Chattanooga a post-school for the children
of poor whites and refugees. It numbered one hundred and
fifty pupils of various ages,—young children, girls of fifteen
and sixteen, one married woman, and boys that were almost
men, all wofully ignorant. Scarcely any of them knew their
letters when they entered the school. The big boys chewed
tobacco, and the big girls “dipped.” The mothers, when
they came to talk with the teacher about their children, appeared
with their nasty, snuffy sticks in their mouths: some
chewed and spat like men. One complained that she was too
poor to send her children to school; at the same time she was
chewing up and spitting away more than the means needful
for the purpose. Tobacco was a necessity of life; education
wasn’t. The tax upon pupils was very small, the school being
mainly supported by what is called the “post-fund,” accruing
from taxes on sutlers, rents of buildings, and military fines.
The post-school is usually designed for the children of soldiers;
but Chattanooga being garrisoned by colored troops, their children
attended the freedmen’s schools.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen’s schools were not in session at the time of
my visit, owing to the small-pox then raging among the negro
population; but I heard an excellent account of them. They
numbered six hundred pupils. The teachers were furnished by
the Western Freedmen’s Aid Society and paid by the freedmen
themselves. One dollar a month was charged for each scholar.
“The colored people,” said the school-superintendent, “are far
more zealous in the cause of education than the whites. They
will starve themselves, and go without clothes, in order to send
their children to school.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding there were three thousand negroes in and
around Chattanooga, Captain Lucas, of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
informed me that he was issuing no rations to them.
All were finding some work to do, and supporting themselves.
To those who applied for aid he gave certificates, requesting
the Commissary to sell them rations at Government rates.
He was helping them to make contracts, and sending them
away to plantations at the rate of fifty or one hundred a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>week. “These people,” said he, “have been terribly slandered
and abused. They are willing to go anywhere, if they
are sure of work and kind treatment. Northern men have
no difficulty in hiring them, but they have no confidence in
their old masters.” It was mostly to Northern men, leasing
plantations in the Mississippi Valley, that the freedmen were
hiring themselves. The usual rate of wages was not less
than twelve nor more than sixteen dollars a month, for full
hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal negro settlement was at Contraband, a village
of huts on the north side of the river. Its affairs were administered
by a colored president and council chosen from among
the citizens. These were generally persons of dignity and
shrewd sense. They constituted a court for the trial of minor
offences, under the supervision of the Bureau. Their decisions,
Captain Lucas informed me, were nearly always wise
and just. “I have to interfere, sometimes, however, to mitigate
the severity of the sentences.” These men showed no
prejudice in favor of their own color, but meted out a rugged
and austere justice to all.</p>

<p class='c000'>One afternoon I crossed the river to pay a visit to this little
village. The huts, built by the negroes themselves, were of a
similar character to those I had seen at Hampton, but they
lacked the big wood-piles and stacks of corn, and the general
air of thrift. Excepting the ravages of the small-pox, the
community was in a good state of health. I found but one
case of sickness,—that of an old negro suffering from a cold
on his lungs, who told me there was nothing in the world he
wouldn’t give to “git shet of dis sher misery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I entered several of these houses; in one of which I surprised
a young couple courting by the fire, and withdrew precipitately,
quite as much embarrassed as they were. In another I found
a middle-aged woman patching clothes for her little boy, who
was at play before the open door. Although it was a summer-like
December day, there was a good fire in the fireplace.
The hut was built of rails and mud; the chimney of sticks and
sun-dried bricks, surmounted by a barrel. The roof was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>split slabs. There was a slab mantel-piece crowded with
bottles and cans; a shelf in one corner loaded with buckets
and pans; and another in the opposite corner devoted to plates,
cups, and mugs. I noticed also in the room a table, a bed, a
bunk, a cupboard, a broom without a handle, two stools, and a
number of pegs on which clothing was hung. All this within
a space not much more than a dozen feet square.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked the woman how her people were getting along.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some are makin’ it right shacklin’,” she replied, “there’s
so many of us here. A heap is workin’, and a heap is lazin’
around.” Her husband was employed whenever he could get
a job. “Sometimes he talks like he’d hire out, then like he’d
sooner take land,—any way to git into work. All have to
support themselves somehow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She knew me for a Northern man. “I’m proud of Northern
men! They’ve caused me to see a heap mo’e pleasure ’n I
ever see befo’e.” Her husband was a good man, but she was
not at all enthusiastic about him. “I had one husband; I
loved him! He belonged to a man that owned a power o’
darkeys. He sold him away. It just broke my heart. But I
couldn’t live without some man, no how; so I thought I might
as well marry again.” She regretted the closing of the schools.
“My chap went a little, but not much.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are these your chickens?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I can’t raise chickens.” It was the fault of her
neighbors. “They just pick ’em up and steal ’em in a
minute! Heap of our people will pick up, but they’re sly.
That comes from the way they was raised. I never stole in
my life but from them that owned me. They’d work me all
day, and never give me enough to eat, and I’d take what I
could from ’em, and believe it was right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing martial music as I returned across the river, I went
up on a hill east of the town and witnessed the dress-parade
of the sixteenth colored regiment (Tennessee). I never saw
a finer military display on a small scale. The drill was perfect.
At the order, a thousand muskets came to a thousand
shoulders with a single movement, or the butts struck the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>ground with one sound along the whole line. The contrast of
colors was superb,—the black faces, the white gloves, the
blue uniforms, the bright steel. The music by the colored
band was mellow and inspiring; and as a background to the
picture we had a golden sunset behind the mountains.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The next morning General Gillem, in command at Chattanooga,
supplied me with a horse, and gave me his orderly for
an attendant, and I set out to make the ascent of Lookout
Mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding out southward on one of the valley roads, we had
hardly crossed Chattanooga Creek before we missed our way.
Fortunately we overtook a farmer and his son, who set us
right. They were laboring over the base of the mountain
with a wagon drawn by a pair of animals that appeared to have
been mated by some whimsical caprice. A tall, bony horse
was harnessed in with the smallest mule I ever saw. Imagine
a lank starved dog beside a rat, and you have an idea of the
ludicrous incongruity of the match.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man had in his wagon a single bag of grist, which he
had to help over the rough mountain-roads by lifting at the
wheels. He had been twelve miles to mill: “away beyant
Missionary Ridge.” I asked him if there was no mill nearer
home. “Thar’s a mill on Wahatchie Crick, but it’s mighty
hard to pull thar. Wahatchie Hill is a powerful bad hill to
pull up.” He did not seem to think twelve miles to mill
anything, and we left him lifting cheerfully at the wheels,
while his son shouted and licked the team. I trust his wife
appreciated that bag of grist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding southward along the eastern side of the mountain,
we commenced the ascent of it by a steep, rough road, winding
among forest-trees, and huge limestone rocks colored with
exquisite tints of brown and gray and green, by the moss and
lichens that covered them. A range of precipitous crags rose
before us, and soon hung toppling over us as we continued to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>climb. A heavy cloud was on the mountain, combed by the
pine-tops a thousand feet above our heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we proceeded, I conversed with the General’s orderly.
He was a good-looking young fellow with short curly hair
and a sallow complexion. I inquired to what regiment he
belonged.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Sixth Ohio, colored.” I looked at him with surprise.
“You didn’t take me for a colored man, I reckon,” he said
laughingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought he must be jesting, but he assured me that he was
not.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was born in bondage,” he said, “near Memphis. My
master was my father, and my mother’s owner. He made a
will that she was to be free, and that I was to learn a trade,
and have my freedom when I was twenty-one. He died
when I was seven years old, and the estate was divided between
his mother and two sisters. I don’t know what became
of the will. I was run off into Middle Tennessee and sold
for three hundred dollars. I was sold again when I was fourteen
for sixteen hundred dollars. I was a carpenter; and
carpenters was high. When I saw other men no whiter than
me working for themselves and enjoying their freedom, I got
discontented, and made up my mind to put out. The year
Buchanan run for President I run for freedom. I got safe
over into Ohio, and there I worked at my trade till the war
broke out. I went out as an officer’s servant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He met with various adventures, and at length became
General Grant’s body-servant. He described the General as
“a short, chunked man, like a Dutchman;” quiet, kind, a
great smoker, a heavy drinker, very silent, and seldom excited.
“There was only one time when he appeared troubled
in his mind. That was on the road to Corinth, after the battle
of Shiloh. He used to walk his room all night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After the government began to make use of colored troops
he went back to Ohio and enlisted. Since the war closed, he
had obtained a furlough, returned to his native place, and
found his mother, who in the mean time had been held as a
slave.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The clouds lifted as we reached the summit of the mountain,
fifteen hundred feet above the river. We passed through
Summer Town, a deserted village, formerly a place of resort
for families from Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, during
the hot season. A rough road over the rocks and through the
woods took us to Point Lookout, a mile farther north.</p>

<p class='c000'>A <em>lookout</em> indeed! What cloud shadows were sweeping the
mountains and valleys! We left our horses tied to some trees,
and clambered down over the ledges to the brink of the precipice.
Away on the northeast was Chattanooga, with its
clusters of roofs resembling saw-teeth. Below us was the
crooked Tennessee, sweeping up to the base of the mountain,
in a coil enclosing on the opposite side a foot-shaped peninsula,
to which the Indians gave the appropriate name of Moccasin
Point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately beneath us, on a shelf of the mountain, between
its river-washed base and the precipice on which we
stood, was the scene of Hooker’s famous “battle in the clouds.”
The Rebels occupied a cleared space on that tremendous elevation.
Behind them rose the crags; before them gloomed the
woods, covering the lower part of the mountain. Along the
cleared space, between the woods and the crags, ran their line
of stone breastworks, which still remained, looking like a
common farm-wall. The enemy had heavy guns on the summit
of the mountain, but they could not be got into position,
or sufficiently depressed, to be of service. Beside, the summit,
on the morning of the attack, was immersed in mist, which
concealed everything. The mist did not envelop the scene of
the fight, however, but hung over it; so that the “battle in
the clouds” was in reality a battle under the clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad runs around the
curve of the river, under the mountain. As we sat looking
down from the Point, a coal-train appeared, crawling along
the track like a black snake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning over the crest to the summit of the road, we paid
a visit to Mr. Foster, known as the “Old Man of the Mountain.”
He was living in a plain country-house on the eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>brow, with the immense panorama of hills and vales and forests
daily before his eyes. He was one of the valiant, unflinching
Union men of the South. In its wild nest on that
crag his liberty-loving soul had lived, untamed as an eagle,
through the perils and persecutions of the war. He was
sixty-nine years old; which fact he expressed in characteristically
quaint style: “Tennessee came, into the Union the
sixth day of June, 1796; and on the twenty-second day of
June I came into the world to see about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His father was a Revolutionary soldier. “He was shot to
pieces, in a manner. It took a heap of his blood to nourish
Uncle Sam when he was a little feller. I recollect his saying
to me, ‘There’s going to be wars; and when they come, I
want you to remember what the Stars and Stripes cost your
old father.’ I did not forget the lesson when this cursed
secession war begun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was by trade a carpenter. He came up on the mountain
to live twenty years before, on account of his health,
which was so poor in the valley that people said he was
going to die, but which had been robust ever since. Twice
during the war he was condemned by the Vigilance Committee
to be hung for his Union sentiments and uncompromising
freedom of speech. Twice the assassins came to his house
to take him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The first time they came, it was Sunday. My wife had
gone over the mountain to preaching, and I was alone. I
loaded up my horse-pistol for ’em,—sixteen buck-shot: I put
in a buck load, I tell ye. There was only two of ’em; and
I thought I was good for three or four. They’d hardly got
inside the gate when I went out to ’em, and asked what they
wanted. One said, ‘We’ve come for Old Foster!’ I just
took the rascal by the arm, and gave him a monstrous clamp,—I
thought I felt the bone,—and shoved him head-over-heels
out of that gate. I was going to shoot t’other feller,
but they rode off so fast down the mountain I had no chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next attempt on his life resulted similarly. After that,
the Committee did not persist in getting him executed. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>was so old, I suppose they thought I was of no account.” He
told of several other Union men, however, whom they had
caused to be hung. “After the Rebels got brushed out,
Sherman and Hooker came to pay me a visit, and denominated
me the ‘Old Man of the Mountain.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SOLDIERS’ CEMETERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A mile and a quarter southeast from the town is the
National Cemetery of Chattanooga. An area of seventy-five
acres has there been set apart by the military authorities for
the burial of the soldiers who died in hospitals or fell on battle-fields
in that region renowned for sanguinary conflicts. It
occupies a hill which seems to have been shaped by Providence
for this purpose: its general form is circular, and it
rises with undulations, showing a beautiful variety of curves
and slopes, to a superb summit, which swells like a green
dome over all.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Thomas, commanding the Division of the Tennessee,
was nominally the director of the cemetery works. But
he appears to have left all in the hands of Mr. Van Horne,
chaplain of the post, who, in addition to his other duties,
assumed the responsible task of laying out the grounds and
supervising the interments. His plan has certainly the merit
of originality, and will prove, in the end, I have no doubt, as
beautiful as it is unique. Copying nothing from the designs
of other cemeteries, he has taken Nature for his guide. The
outline of each separate section is determined by its location.
Here, for example, is a shield,—the rise of the ground and
the natural lines of depression suggesting that form. In the
centre of each section is a monument; immediately surrounding
which are the graves of officers, in positions according to
their numbers and rank; while around the latter are grouped
the graves of private soldiers, in lines adapted to the general
shape of the section. The paths and avenues follow the hollows
and curves which sweep from the base in every direction
towards the summit. This is surrounded by a single circular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>avenue; and is to be crowned, according to the chaplain’s
plan, with a grand central monument, an historic temple
overlooking the whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place will abound in groups of trees, verdant lawns
and slopes, magnificent vistas, and concealed views designed
to surprise the visitor at every step. Outcropping ledges and
bold, romantic rocks afford a delightful contrast to the green
of the trees and grass, and to the smoothness of the slopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside the avenue which girds the base of the hill is a cave
with galleries and chambers sculptured in a variety of forms
by the action of water on the limestone rock. The chaplain,
who accompanied me on my visit to the cemetery, sent for a
guide and a light, and we explored this natural grotto a hundred
feet or more, until we came to passages too narrow to
admit us into the unknown chambers beyond. Besides the
entrance from the avenue, there is an opening which affords
a glimpse of the blue sky by day, or of the stars by night,
through the roof of the cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hill rises from the Valley midway between Lookout
Mountain and Missionary Ridge, commanding a view of all
that historic region. The Tennessee is visible, distant a mile
or more. The chaplain told me that when the river was very
high, water came in and filled the galleries of the cave; thus
showing that they were of great extent, and mysteriously connected
with the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work on the cemetery had thus far been performed by
details from the army. The post-fund, which amounted to
twenty-seven thousand dollars, had defrayed all expenses.
But this cannot continue. The time is coming when the
people of the States will be called upon to pay the debt they
owe to the heroic dead, in liberal contributions towards the
completion and adornment of this spot, where probably will
be gathered together a more numerous host of the slain than
in any other national cemetery. From Chickamauga and
Mission Ridge, from Lookout Mountain and Wahatchie, from
the scenes of many lesser fights, from the hospitals, and possibly
also from the fields of Sherman’s Atlanta campaign,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>thousands upon thousands they will come, a silent host, to this
goal of future pilgrimages, this “Mecca of American memories.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nine thousand had already been interred there at the time
of my visit. No attempt was made to bury the dead by
States. “I am tired of State Rights,” said General Thomas;
“let’s have a <em>national</em> cemetery.” Out of six thousand interred
before the removal of the dead of Chickamauga was
begun, only four hundred were unknown. A military record
is kept, in which are inscribed all ascertainable facts respecting
each,—his name, rank, company, arm of service, native
State, age; time, place, and cause of death; address of nearest
friends, and so forth; accompanied by a full regimental index,
and an individual index; so that persons in search of the graves
of friends can learn by a brief examination all that is known
about them, and be guided at once to the section and number
where their remains are deposited. The chaplain told me that
many who had come with a determination to remove the bodies
of their dead, immediately on seeing the cemetery had changed
that determination, convinced that they could have no more
fitting resting-place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dead of Chickamauga were being interred while I was
there; and the chaplain kindly offered to accompany me to
the battle-field, where a regiment of colored soldiers were at
work exhuming the buried, and gathering together the remains
of the unburied dead.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>MISSION RIDGE AND CHICKAMAUGA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly, one cloudy December morning the chaplain,
accompanied by two ladies of his household, took me up at my
hotel, and drove us out of Chattanooga on the Rossville Road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the open valley behind us we crossed a bushy plain,
and passed through a clump of oaken woods. Before us, on
the east, rose Missionary Ridge, forest-covered, its steep sides
all russet-hued with fallen leaves, visible through the naked
brown trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chaplain who witnessed the scene, described to us the
storming of those heights by the Army of the Cumberland, on
the twenty-fifth of November, a little more than two years before.
It was the finishing stroke to which the affair at Lookout
Mountain was the brilliant prelude. It was the revenge
for Chickamauga. There was a Rebel line of works along
the base of the ridge; and the crests were defended by infantry
and heavy artillery. The charge was ordered; and
forward across the plain and up the slope swept a single
glittering line of steel six miles in length. The Rebels were
driven from their lower works by the bayonet. The army
rushed forward without firing a shot, and pausing only to take
breath for a moment in the depressions of the hill; then onward
again, storming the heights, from which burst upon them
a whistling and howling storm of iron and lead. General
Thomas says the Ridge was carried simultaneously at six different
points. The attack commenced at three o’clock in the
afternoon; at four the crests were taken, and Bragg’s army in
flight. The first captured gun was turned upon the enemy by
Corporal Kramer of the Forty-first Ohio regiment, belonging
to Hazen’s brigade of Wood’s division. He discharged it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>firing his musket over the vent. It took six men to carry the
colors of the First Ohio to the summit, five falling by the way
in the attempt. Corporal Angelbeck, finding a Rebel caisson
on fire, cut it loose from the horses and run it off down the
hill before it exploded. These instances of personal intrepidity
(which I give on the authority of Major-General Hazen,
whom I saw afterwards at Murfreesboro’) are but illustrations
of the gallantry shown by our troops along the whole line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plain we were crossing was the same which General
Hooker’s forces swept over in their pursuit of the enemy.
We passed the Georgia State-line; and, amid hilly woods
filled with a bushy undergrowth, entered the mountain solitudes;
crossing Missionary Ridge by the Rossville Gap. Rossville,
which consisted of a blacksmith-shop and dwelling in the
Gap, had been burned to the ground. Beyond this point the
road forked; the left-hand track leading to Ringold, the right
to Lafayette.</p>

<p class='c000'>Driving southward along the Lafayette Road we soon
reached the site of Cloud Spring Hospital, in the rear of the
battle-field. A desolate, dreary scene: the day was cold and
wet; dead leaves strewed the ground; the wind whistled in
the trees. There were indications that here the work of disinterment
was about to begin. Shovels and picks were ready
on the ground; and beside the long, low trenches of the dead
waited piles of yellow pine coffins spattered with rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little further on we came to traces of the conflict,—boughs
broken and trees cut off by shells. We rode southward
along the line of battle, over an undulating plain, with
sparse timber on one side, and on the other a field of girdled
trees, which had been a cotton-field at the time of the battle.
These ghostly groves, called “deadenings,” sometimes seen
in other parts of the country, are an especial feature of the
Southern landscape. When timbered land is to be put under
cultivation, the trees, instead of being cut away, are often
merely deadened with the axe, which encircles them with a
line severing the bark, and there left to stand and decay slowly
through a series of years. First the sapless bark flakes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>falls piecemeal, and the wind breaks off the brittle twigs and
small boughs. Next the larger branches come down; and
the naked trunk, covered in the course of time by a dry-rot,
and perforated by worms and the bills of woodpeckers, stands
with the stumps of two or three of its largest topmost limbs
upstretched in stern and sullen gloom to heaven. There is
something awful and sublime in the aspect of a whole forest of
such. The tempest roars among them, but not a limb sways.
Spring comes, and all around the woods are green and glad,
but not a leaf or tender bud puts forth upon the spectral
trunks. The sun rises, and the field is ruled by the shadows
of these pillars, which sweep slowly around, shortening as noon
approaches, and lengthening again at the approach of night.
Corn and cotton flourish well; the powdery rot and half-decayed
fragments which fall serving as a continual nourishment
to the soil. It takes from ten to twenty years for these
corpses standing over their graves to crumble and disappear
beneath them. Sometimes they rot to the roots; or, when all
is ready, a hurricane hurls his crashing balls, and the whole
grove goes down in a night-time, like ten-pins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dismal enough looked the “deadening,” in the cold and
drizzling rain that morning on the battle-field. Scarcely less
so seemed the woods beyond, all shattered and torn by shot and
shell, as if a tornado had swept them. On the northern side
of these was Kelly’s house. The Dyer Farm was beyond;
upon which we found two hundred colored soldiers encamped,
in a muddy village of winter huts near the ruins of the burned
farm-house. The Dyer family were said to be excellent
Rebels. Dyer served as a guerilla; and it was his wife who
burned her feather-bed in order that it might not be used by
our wounded soldiers. After that patriotic act she wandered
off in the woods and died. Her husband had since returned,
and was now living in a new log-hut within sight of the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camp was a strange spectacle. The men were cooking
their dinners or drying their clothes around out-door fires of
logs which filled the air with smoke. Near by were piles of
coffins,—some empty, some containing the remains of soldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that had just been disinterred. The camp was surrounded by
fields of stumps and piny undergrowth. Here and there were
scattered trees, hitched at some of which were mules munching
their dinners of wet hay.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were two hundred and seventeen soldiers in camp.
At first they had a horror of the work for which they were
detailed. All the superstition of the African was roused
within them at sight of the mouldering dead. They declared
that the skulls moved, and started back with shrieks. An
officer, to encourage them, unconcernedly took out the bones
from a grave and placed them carefully in a coffin. They
were induced to imitate his example. In a few hours they
chatted or whistled and sang at their work; and in a few days
it was common to see them perform their labor and eat their
luncheons at the same time,—lay bones into the coffin with
one hand, and hold with the other the hard-tack they were
nibbling.</p>

<p class='c000'>More than nine tenths of the bodies taken from Chickamauga
were unknown. Some had been buried in trenches;
some singly; some laid side by side, and covered with a little
earth, perhaps not more than six inches deep, leaving feet and
skull exposed; and many had not been buried at all. Throughout
the woods were scattered these lonely graves. The method
of finding them was simple. A hundred men were deployed
in a line, a yard apart, each examining half a yard of ground
on both sides of him, as they proceeded. Thus was swept a
space five hundred yards in breadth. Trees were blazed or
stakes set along the edge of this space, to guide the company
on its return. In this manner the entire battle-field had been
or was to be searched. When a grave was found, the entire
line was halted until the teams came up and the body was removed.
Many graves were marked with stakes, but some
were to be discovered only by the raised or disturbed appearance
of the ground. Those bodies which had been buried in
trenches were but little decomposed; while of those buried
singly in boxes not much was left but the bones and a handful
of dust.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>We had diverged from the Lafayette Road in order to ride
along the line of battle east of it,—passing the positions occupied
on Sunday, the second day, by Baird, Johnson, and Palmer’s
divisions, respectively. Next to Palmer was Reynolds;
then came Brannan, then Wood, then Davis, then Sheridan,
on the extreme right. The line, which on Saturday ran due
north and south, east of the road,—the left resting at Kelly’s
house and the right at Gordon’s Mills,—was on Sunday
curved, the right being drawn in and lying diagonally across
and behind the road. In front (on the east) was Chickamauga
Creek. Missionary Ridge was in the rear; on a spur of which
the right rested. I recapitulate these positions, because newspaper
accounts of the battle, and historical accounts based
upon them, are on two or three points confused and contradictory:
and because an understanding of them is important
to what I am about to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quitting the camp, we approached the scene of the great
blunder which lost us the battle of Chickamauga. At half-past
nine in the morning the attack commenced, the Rebels
hurling masses of troops with their accustomed vigor against
Rosecrans’s left and centre. Not a division gave way: the
whole line stood firm and unmoved: all was going well; when
Rosecrans sent the following imperative order to General
Wood:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>Close up as fast as possible on General Reynolds, and support
him.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Brannan’s division, as you have noticed, was between
Wood and Reynolds. How then could Wood close up
on Reynolds without taking out his division and marching by
the left flank in Brannan’s rear? In military parlance, to
<em>close up</em> may mean two quite different things. It may mean
to move by the flank in order to close a gap which occurs between
one body of troops and another body. Or it may mean
to make a similar movement to that by which a rank of soldiers
is said to <em>close up</em> on the rank in front of it. To <em>close to
the right or left</em>, is one thing; to <em>close up on</em>, another. To General
Wood, situated as he was, the order could have no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>meaning than the latter. He could not <em>close up</em> on General
Reynolds and support him without taking a position in his
rear. Yet the order seemed to him very extraordinary. To
General McCook, who was present when it was received, he
remarked,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is very singular! What am I to do?” For to take
out his division was to make a gap in the army which might
prove fatal to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The order is so positive,” replied McCook, “that you
must obey it at once. Move your division out, and I will
move Davis’s in to fill the gap. Move quick, or you won’t be
out of the way before I bring in his division.”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Wood saw no alternative but to obey the order.
He would have been justified in disobeying it, only on the
supposition that the commanding general was ignorant of the
position of his forces. Had Rosecrans been absent from the
field, such a supposition would have been reasonable, and such
disobedience duty. But Rosecrans was on the field; and he
was supposed to know infinitely more than could be known
to any division commander concerning the exigencies of the
battle. Had Wood kept his place, and Reynolds been overwhelmed
and the field lost in consequence of that act of
insubordination, he would have deserved to be court-martialled
and shot. On the contrary, he moved his division
out, and in consequence of his strict <em>obedience</em> to orders the
field was lost. He had scarcely opened the gap between
Brannan and Davis, when the Rebels rushed in and cut
the army to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Rosecrans, in his official report, sought to shift the
responsibility of this fatal movement from his own shoulders
to those of General Wood. This was manifestly unjust. It
appears to me that the true explanation of it lies in the fact
that Rosecrans, although a man of brilliant parts, had not
the steady balance of mind necessary to a great general. He
could organize an army, or plan a campaign in his tent; but
he had no self-possession on the field of battle. In great
emergencies he became confused and forgetful. It was probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>this nervousness and paralysis of memory which caused
the disaster at Chickamauga. He had forgotten the position
of his forces. He intended to order General Wood to close
to the left on Brannan; or on Reynolds, forgetting that Brannan
was between them. But the order was to close up on
and <em>support</em> Reynolds; whereas Reynolds, like Brannan, was
doing very well, and did not particularly need support.</p>

<p class='c000'>The routed divisions of the army fled to Chattanooga,—the
commanding general among the foremost; where he hastened
to telegraph to the War Department and the dismayed
nation that all was lost; while General Garfield, his chief of
staff, extricating himself from the rabble, rode back to the
part of the field where firing was still heard,—running the
gauntlet of the enemy’s lines,—and joined General Thomas,
who, rallying fragments of corps on a spur of Missionary
Ridge, was stemming the tide of the foe, and saving the army
from destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through woods dotted all over with the graves of soldiers
buried where they fell, we drove to the scene of that final fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bones of dead horses strewed the ground. At the foot of
the wooded hill were trenches full of Longstreet’s slaughtered
men. That was to them a most tragical termination to what
had seemed a victory. Inspired by their recent success, they
charged again and again up those fatal slopes, only to be cut
down like ripe grain by the deadly volleys which poured from
a crescent of flame and smoke, where the heroic remnant of the
army had taken up its position, and was not to be dislodged.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>FROM CHATTANOOGA TO MURFREESBORO’.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The military operations, of which Chattanooga was so long
the centre, have left their mark upon all the surrounding
country. Travel which way you will, you are sure to follow
in their track. There are fortifications at every commanding
point. Every railroad bridge is defended by redoubts and
block-houses; and many important bridges have been burned.
The entire route to Atlanta is a scene of conflict and desolation:
earthworks, like the foot-prints of a Titan on the march;
rifle-pits extending for miles along the railroad track; hills all
dug up into forts and entrenchments; the town of Marietta in
ruins; farms swept clean of their fences and buildings; everywhere,
along the blackened war-path, solitary standing chimneys
left, “like exclamation points,” to emphasize the silent
story of destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw a few “Union men” at Chattanooga. But their
loyalty was generally of a qualified sort. One, who was well
known for his daring opposition to the secession leaders, and
for his many narrow escapes from death, told me how he lived
during the war. Once when the Rebels came to kill him, they
took his brother instead. His residence was on a hill, and
three times subsequently he saved his life by taking a canoe
and crossing the river in it when he saw his assassins coming.
Yet this man hated the free negro worse than he hated the
Rebels; and he said to me, “If the government attempts now
to force negro-suffrage upon the South, it will have to wade
through a sea of blood to which all that has been shed was
only a drop!” Another, who claimed also to be a Union
man, said, “Before the South will ever consent to help pay
the National debt, there will be another rebellion bigger than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the last. You would make her repudiate her own war-debt,
and then pay the expenses of her own whipping. I tell you,
this can’t be done.” The threats of another rebellion, and of
an extraordinarily large sea of blood, were not, I suppose, to be
understood literally. This is the fiery Southron’s metaphorical
manner of expressing himself. Yet these men were perfectly
sincere in their profession of sentiments which one would have
expected to hear only from the lips of Rebels.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of Thursday, December 14th, I bid a joyful
farewell to Chattanooga, which is by no means a delightful
place to sojourn in, and took the train for Murfreesboro’.
The weather was cold, and growing colder. Winter had come
suddenly, and very much in earnest. Huge icicles hung from
the water-tanks by the railroad. The frost, pushing its crystal
shoots up out of the porous ground, looked like thick growths
of fungus stalks. The rain and mist of the previous night
were congealed upon the trees; and the Cumberland Mountains,
as we passed them, appeared covered with forests of
silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country was uninteresting. Well-built farm-houses
were not common; but log-huts, many of them without
windows, predominated. These were inhabited by negroes
and poor whites. I remember one family living in a box-car
that had been run off the track. Another occupied a grotesque
cabin having for a door the door of a car, set up endwise,
marked conspicuously in letters reading from the zenith to the
nadir, “U. S. MILITARY R. R.” We passed occasionally
cotton-fields, resembling at that season and in that climate
fields of low black weeds, with here and there a bunch of cotton
sticking to the dry leafy stalks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next me sat a gentleman from Iowa, whose history was a
striking illustration of the difference between a slave State
and a free State. He had just been to visit a brother living
in Georgia. They were natives of North Carolina, from which
State they emigrated in early manhood. He chose the Northwest;
his brother chose the South; and they had now met for
the first time since their separation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“To me,” said he, “it was a very sad meeting. Georgia
is a hundred years behind Iowa. My brother has always
been poor, and always will be poor. If I had to live as he
does, I should think I had not the bare necessaries of life,
not to speak of comforts. His children are growing up in
ignorance. When I looked at them, and thought of my
own children,—intelligent, cultivated, with their schools, their
books, and magazines, and piano,—I was so much affected I
couldn’t speak, and for a minute I’d have given anything if
I hadn’t seen how he was situated. It isn’t my merit, nor
his fault, that there is so great a difference now, between us,
who were so much alike when boys. If he had gone to Iowa,
he would have done as well as I have. If I had gone to
Georgia, I should have done as poorly as he has.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the only Northern man in the car besides myself,—as
was to be seen not only by the countenances of the other
passengers, but also by the spirit of their conversation. Behind
us sat an ignorant brute, with his shirt bosom streaked
with tobacco drizzle, who was saying in a loud, fierce tone,
that “we’d better kill off the balance of the niggers,” for he
had “no use for ’em now they were free.” Others were
talking about Congress and the President. One little boy
four years old amused us all. He enjoyed the range of the
car, and had made several acquaintances, some of whom, to
plague him, called him Billy Yank. Great was the little fellow’s
indignation at this insult. “I a’n’t Billy Yank! I’m
Johnny Reb!” he insisted. As the teasing continued, he flew
to his mother, who received him in her arms. “Yes, he <em>is</em>
Johnny Reb! <em>so he is!</em>” And his little heart was comforted.</p>

<p class='c000'>At half-past three we reached Murfreesboro’, having been
nine hours travelling one hundred and nine miles. This I
found about the average rate of speed on Southern roads.
The trains run slow, and a great deal of time is lost at
stopping-places. Once, when we were wooding up, I went
out to learn what was keeping us so long, and saw two of the
hands engaged in a scuffle, which the rest were watching with
human interest. On another occasion the men had to bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>wood out of the forest, none having been provided for the
engine near the track.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murfreesboro’ is situated very near the centre of the State.
It had in 1860 three thousand inhabitants. It has six
churches, and not a decent hotel. Before the war it enjoyed
the blessing of a University, a military institute, two female
colleges, and two high-schools; all of which had been discontinued.
It was also described to me as “a pretty, shady
village, before the war.” But the trees had been cut away,
leaving ugly stump-lots; and the country all around was laid
desolate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knowing how wretched must be my accommodations at the
only tavern then open to the public, General Hazen hospitably
insisted on my removal to his head-quarters on the evening of
my arrival. I found him occupying a first-class Tennessee
mansion on a hill just outside the town. The house was cruciform,
with a spacious hall and staircase in the centre, opening
into lofty wainscoted rooms above and below. The richness
of the dark panels, and the structural elegance of the
apartments, were unexceptionable. But the occupants of
these could never have known comfort in wintry weather.
The house was built, like all southern houses, for a climate
reputed mild, but liable to surprises of cruel and treacherous
cold, against which the inhabitants make no provision. The
General and I sat that evening talking over war times, with a
huge fire roaring before us in the chimney, and roasting our
faces, while the freezing blast blew upon our backs from irremediable
crevices in the ill-jointed wainscots and casements.
I slept that night in a particularly airy chamber, with a good
fire striving faithfully to master the enemy, and found in the
morning the contents of the water-pitcher, that stood in the
room, fast frozen.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was amused by the grimaces of the negro servant who
came in to replenish the fire before I was up. He inquired if
we had any colder weather than that in the North, and when
I told him how I had seen iron pump-handles stick to a wet
hand on a fine wintry morning, involving sometimes the sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>of epidermis before the teeth of the frost could be made
to let go, he remarked excitedly,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wouldn’t let de iron git holt o’ my hand! I hain’t no
skin to spar’, mornin’ like dis sher!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I sat at breakfast with the General, he told me of his
official intercourse with the inhabitants, since he had been in
command of the post. “The most I have to do,” said he,
“is to adjust difficulties between Union men and Rebels.
There are many men living in this country who acted as scouts
for our army, and who, when they wanted a horse to use in
the service of the government, took it without much ceremony
where they could find it. For acts of this kind the law-loving
Rebels are now suing them for damages before the civil courts,
and persecuting them in various ways, so that the military
power has to interfere to protect them.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>STONE RIVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>After breakfast in a large dining-room which no fuel could
heat, we went and stood by the hearth, turning ourselves on
our heels, as the earth turns on its axis, warming a hemisphere
at a time, until the wintry condition of our bodies gave place
to a feeling of spring, half sunshine and half chill; then we
clapped on our overcoats and mufflers; then two powerful
war-horses of the General’s came prancing to the door, ready
bridled and saddled; and we mounted. A vigorous gallop
across the outskirts of the town and out on the Nashville Pike
set the sympathetic blood also on a gallop, and did for us what
fire in a Tennessee mansion could not do. In ten minutes we
were thoroughly warm, with the exception of one thumb in a
glove which I wore, and an ear on the windward side of the
General’s rosy face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding amid stump-fields, where beautiful forests had cast
their broad shades before the war, we entered the area of
the vast fortress constructed by the army of Rosecrans,
lying at Murfreesboro’ after the battle. This is the largest
work of the kind in the United States. A parapet of earth
three miles in circumference encloses a number of detached
redoubts on commanding eminences. The encircled space
is a mile in diameter. It contained all Rosecrans’s storehouses,
and was large enough to take in his entire army. It
would require at least ten thousand troops to man its breastworks.
The converging lines of the railroad and turnpike
running to Nashville pass through it; and across the north
front sweeps a bend of Stone River. We found the stream
partly frozen, chafing between abrupt rocky shores sheathed
in ice.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>A mile beyond, the converging lines above mentioned cut
each other at a sharp angle; the railroad, which goes out of
Murfreesboro’ on the left, shifting over to the right of the
turnpike. Crossing them at nearly right angles, a short distance
on the Murfreesboro’ side of their point of intersection,
was the Rebel line of battle, on the morning of the thirty-first
of December. Half a mile beyond this point, on the
Nashville side, was the Union line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroad here runs through a cut, with a considerable
embankment,—a circumstance of vital importance to our
army, saving it, probably, from utter rout and destruction, on
that first day of disaster. The right wing, thrown out two
miles and more to the west of the railroad, rested on nothing.
It was left hanging in the air, as the French say. An attack
was expected, yet no precautions were taken to provide
against an attack. General Wood, who had posted scouts in
trees to observe the movements of the Rebels, reported to the
commanding general that they were rapidly moving troops
over and massing them on their left. Rosecrans says he sent
the information to McCook; McCook says he never received
it. When the attack came, it was a perfect surprise. It was
made with the suddenness and impetuosity for which the
enemy was distinguished, and everything gave way before it.
Division after division was pushed back, until the line, which
was projected nearly perpendicular to the railroad in the
morning, lay parallel to it,—that providential cut affording
an opportune cover for the rallying and re-forming of the
troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another feature of the field is eminently noticeable. The
bold river banks, curving in and out, along by the east side of
the railroad, made a strong position for the Union left to rest
upon. Here, in a little grove called by the Rebels the “Round
Forest,” between the river and the railroad, was General
Wood’s division, planted like a post. On his right, like a bolt
of iron in that post, was Hazen’s brigade, serving as a pivot
on which the whole army line swung round like a gate. The
pivot itself was immovable. In vain the enemy concentrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>his utmost efforts against it. Terribly smitten and battered,
but seemingly insensible as iron itself, there it stuck.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was extremely interesting to visit this portion of the field
in company with one who played so important a part in the
events enacted there. We rode through a cotton-field of
black leafy stalks, with little white bunches clinging to them
like feathers or snow. It was across that field, between Round
Forest and the railroad, that Hazen’s line was formed. On
the edge of it, by the forest, still lay the bones of a horse
shot under him during the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near by was a little cemetery, within which the dead of
Hazen’s brigade were buried. A well-built stone wall encloses
an oblong space one hundred feet in length by forty in breadth.
Within are thirty-one limestone tablets marking the graves
of the common soldiers. In the midst of these stands a monument,
on which are inscribed the names of officers whose
remains are deposited beneath it. This is also of limestone,
massy, well formed, ten feet square on the ground and eleven
feet in height. It is interesting as being the only monument
of importance and durability erected by soldiers during the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the south side, facing the railroad and turnpike, is the
following legend:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“HAZEN’S BRIGADE</div>
    <div>TO</div>
    <div>THE MEMORY OF ITS SOLDIERS</div>
    <div>WHO FELL AT</div>
    <div>STONE RIVER, DEC. 31, 1862.</div>
    <div>‘<em>Their faces toward heaven, their feet to the foe.</em>’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>On the east side is the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>The Veterans of Shiloh have left a deathless
heritage of fame upon the field of Stone River.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the north side:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Erected 1863, upon the ground where they fell, by their
comrades of the Nineteenth Brigade, Buell’s Army of the
Ohio, Col. W. B. Hazen 41st Infantry O. Vols. commanding.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the west side:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The blood of one third its soldiers twice spilled in Tennessee
crimsons the battle-flag of the brigade and inspires to
great deeds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From the soldiers’ cemetery at Round Forest we rode on
to the new National Cemetery of Stone River, then in process
of construction. It lies between the railroad and the turnpike,
in full view from both. A massy square-cornered stone
wall encloses a space of modest size, sufficiently elevated, and
covered with neatly heaped mounds, side by side, and row behind
row, in such precise order, that one might imagine the
dead who sleep beneath them to have formed their ghostly
ranks there after the battle, and carefully laid themselves
down to rest beneath those small green tents. The tents were
not green when I visited the spot, but I trust they are green
to-day, and that the birds are singing over them.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The right brigade of Palmer’s division had been the last to yield. The left brigade,
in command of Hazen, was thus exposed to fire in flank and rear, and to the
attempts of the enemy to charge in front. It required terrible fighting to beat back
the enemy’s double lines: it cost a third of the brave brigade; but every moment the
enemy was held back was worth a thousand men to the main line. General Rosecrans
improved the time so well, in hurrying troops to the new position, that, when the
enemy assailed that line, the fresh divisions of Van Cleve, Wood, and Rousseau,
and the artillery massed on a commanding point, not only repulsed them, but they
were charged while retiring by one of Crittenden’s brigades.... The enemy
had miscalculated the temper of Hazen’s brigade; and Bragg was obliged to report,
as he did in his first despatch, that he “had driven the whole Federal line, except his
left, which stubbornly resisted.”—<cite>Annals of the Army of the Cumberland.</cite></p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE HEART OF TENNESSEE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Having spent the remainder of the forenoon in riding over
other portions of the field, we returned to Murfreesboro’; and
at half-past three o’clock I took the train for Nashville.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Nashville I remained four days,—four eminently disagreeable
days of snow, and rain, and fog, and slush, and
mud. Yet I formed a not unfavorable impression of the city.
I could feel the influence of Northern ideas and enterprise
pulsating through it. Its population, which was less than
twenty-four thousand at the last census, nearly doubled during
the war. Its position gives it activity and importance. It is
a nostril through which the State has long breathed the
Northern air of free institutions. It is a port of entry on the
Cumberland, which affords it steamboat communication with
the great rivers. It is a node from which radiate five important
railroads connecting it with the South and North. The
turnpikes leading out of it in every direction are the best system
of roads I met with anywhere in the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>Middle Tennessee is the largest of the three natural divisions
of the State. It is separated from the West division by
the Tennessee River, and from East Tennessee by the Cumberland
Mountains. It is a fine stock-raising country; and the
valley of the Cumberland River affords an extensive tract of
excellent cotton and tobacco lands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nashville is the great commercial emporium of this division.
The largest annual shipment of cotton from this port was fifty
thousand bales; the average, before the war, was about half
as many: during 1865, it was fully up to this average, consisting
mostly of old cotton going to market. Six thousand
hogsheads of tobacco, two million bushels of corn, and twenty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>thousand hogs,—besides ten thousand casks of bacon and
twenty-five hundred tierces of lard,—were yearly shipped
from this port. The manufacturing interest of the place is insignificant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prospects of the country for the present year seemed to
me favorable. The freedmen were making contracts, and
going to work. Returned Rebels were generally settling down
to a quiet life, and turning their attention to business. The
people were much disposed to plant cotton, and every effort
was making to put their desolated farms into a tillable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Middle Tennessee is but an indifferent cotton-growing
region. It is inferior to West Tennessee, and can scarcely be
called a cotton country, when compared with the rich valleys
of the more Southern States. Eight hundred pounds of seed
cotton<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> to the acre are considered a good crop on the best
lands. The quality of Middle Tennessee cotton never rates
above “low middling,” but generally below it, (the different
qualities of cotton being classed as follows: inferior, ordinary,
good ordinary, low middling, middling, good middling, middling
fair, good fair, and fine.)</p>

<p class='c000'>I found considerable business doing with an article which
never before had any money-value. Cotton seed, which used
to be cast out from the gin-houses and left to rot in heaps, the
planter reserving but a small portion for the ensuing crop,
was now in great demand, prices varying from one to three
dollars a bushel. In some portions of the Rebel States it had
nearly run out during the war, and those sections which, like
Tennessee, had continued the culture of the plant, were supplying
the deficiency. The seed, I may here mention, resembles,
after the fibre is removed by the gin, a small-sized pea
covered with fine white wool. It is very oily, and is considered
the best known fertilizer for cotton lands.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>Nashville is built on the slopes of a hill rising from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>south bank of the Cumberland. Near the summit, one
hundred and seventy-five feet above the river, stands the
capitol, said to be the finest State capitol in the United States.
The view it commands of the surrounding country is superb;
and seen from afar off, it seems, with its cupola and Ionic
porticoes, to rest upon the city like a crown. It is constructed
of fine fossiliferous limestone, three stories in height; with a
central tower lifting the cupola two hundred feet from the
ground. This tower is the one bad feature about the building.
It is not imposing. The site is a lofty crest of rock, which
was fortified during the war, converting the capitol into a
citadel. The parapets thrown up around the edifice still
remain.</p>

<p class='c000'>My visit happened on the first anniversary of the battle of
Nashville, which took place on the fifteenth and sixteenth days
of December, 1864;—a battle which, occurring after many
great and sanguinary conflicts, did not rise to highest fame;
and which has not yet had ample justice done it. It is to
be distinguished as the only immediately decisive battle of the
war,—the only one in which an army was destroyed. By it
the army of Hood was annihilated, and a period put to Rebel
power in the States which Sherman had left behind him on his
great march.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene of the battle, the sweeping undulations of the
plain, the fields, the clumps of woods, and the range of hills
beyond, are distinctly visible in fair weather from the house-tops
of the city, and especially from the capitol. The fight
took place under the eyes of the citizens. Every “coigne of
vantage” was black with spectators. Patriots and Rebel
sympathizers were commingled: the friends and relatives of
both armies crowding together to witness the deadly struggle;
a drama of fearfully intense reality! The wife of a noted
general officer who was in the thickest of the fight, told me
something of her experience, watching from the capitol with a
glass the movements of his troops, the swift gallop of couriers,
the charge, the repulse, the successful assault, the ground
dotted with the slain, and the awful battle cloud, rolling over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>all, enfolding, as she at one time believed, his dead form with
the rest. But he lived; he was present when she told me
the story;—and shall I ever forget the emotion with which
he listened to the recital? The battle was no such terrible
thing to the soldier in the midst of it, as to the loved one looking
on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The State legislature adjourned for the Christmas holidays
on the morning of my visit to the capitol; but I was in time
to meet and converse with members from various parts of the
State. They were generally a plain, candid, earnest class of
men. They were the loyal salt of the State. Some of them
were from districts in which there were no Union men to
elect them; to meet which contingency the names of the
candidates for both houses had been placed on a general ticket.
Thus members from West and Middle Tennessee, where the
Rebel element was paramount, were elected by votes in East
Tennessee, which was loyal.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Mr. Frierson, Speaker of the Senate, I had a long
conversation. He was from Maury County, and a liberal-minded,
progressive man, for that intensely pro-slavery and
Rebel district. We talked on the exciting topic of the hour,—negro
suffrage, and the admission of negro testimony in the
courts. “My freedmen,” he said, “are far more intelligent
and better prepared to vote, than the white population around
us.” Yet as a class he did not think the negroes prepared to
exercise the right of suffrage, and he was in favor of granting
it only to such as had served in the Union army. To the negroes’
loyalty and good behavior he gave the highest praise.
“It is said they would have fought for the Confederacy, if the
opportunity had been given them in season. But I know the
negro, and I know that his heart was true to the Union from
the first, and throughout; and I do not believe he would have
fought for the Rebellion, even on the promise of his liberty.”
He thought the blacks competent to give testimony in the
courts; but for this step society in Tennessee was not prepared.
Both the right of voting and of testifying must be
given them before long, however.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>There were two classes of Union men in Tennessee. One
class had manifested their loyalty by their uncompromising
acts and sacrifices. The other class were merely <em>legal</em> Union
men, professing loyalty to the government and friendliness to
the negro. “These are not to be trusted,” said Mr. Frierson.
“Their animosity against the government and the freedmen,
and more particularly against <em>heart</em> Union men, is all the more
dangerous because it is secret.” And it was necessary in his
opinion to retain the Freedmen’s Bureau in the State, and to
keep both Rebels and rebel sympathizers excluded from power,
for some years.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have given so much of this conversation to illustrate the
views entertained by the average, moderate, common-sense
Union men of Tennessee. Far behind them, on the question
of human rights, were some of the negro-haters and Rebel-persecutors
of East Tennessee; while there was a handful of
leading men as far in advance of them. A good sample of
these was the honorable John Trimble, of Nashville, also a
member of the legislature, whom I had the satisfaction of
meeting on two or three occasions: a man of liberal and cultivated
mind, singularly emancipated from cant and prejudice.
He had just introduced into the General Assembly a bill extending
the elective franchise to the freedmen, with certain
restrictions; for the passage of which there was of course little
chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was just in time to catch Governor Brownlow as he was
about going home for the holidays. I should have been sorry
to miss seeing this remarkable type of native Southern-Western
wit. As an outspoken convert from the pro-slavery doctrines
he used to advocate, to the radical ideas which the agitations
of the times had shaken to the surface of society, he was
also interesting to me. I found him a tall, quiet individual,
of a nervous temperament, intellectual forehead, and a gift of
language,—with nothing of the blackguard in his manners,
as readers of his writings might sometimes be led to expect.
His conversation was characteristic. He believed a Rebel had
no rights except to be hung in this world, and damned after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>death. But this and other similar expressions did not proceed
so much from a vindictive nature, as from that tendency to a
strong, extravagant style of statement, for which Western and
Southern people, and especially the people of Tennessee, are
noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of his compatriots, the Union-loving East Tennesseeans, he
said, “It is hard to tell which they hate most, the Rebels, or
the negroes.” He did not sympathize with them in the ill-feeling
they bestowed upon the latter. He was in favor of
the Negro Testimony Bill, which had just been defeated in the
legislature by East Tennessee members; and as for negro
suffrage, he thought it was sure to come in a few years.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Rebels,” said he, “are as rebellious now as ever. If
Thomas and his bayonets were withdrawn, in ten days a Rebel
mob would drive this legislature out. Congress,” he added,
“will have to legislate for all the Rebel States, Tennessee
with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Governor’s I went over to the division head-quarters
to call on Major-General Thomas,—a very different
type of native Southern men. Born and bred a Virginian,
his patriotism was national, knowing no State boundaries. In
appearance, he is the most lion-like of all the Union generals
I have seen. An imperturbable, strong soul, never betrayed
into weakness or excess by any excitement, his opinions possessed
for me great value.</p>

<p class='c000'>We spoke of the national soldiers’ cemeteries in his division;
and he informed me that besides those I had visited at Chattanooga
and Murfreesboro’, others proposed by him had been
sanctioned by the War Department. “We shall have one
here at Nashville; and I have already selected the site for
it,”—a fortified hill in the suburbs. “There will be one at
Franklin; also one at Memphis; another at Shiloh; and another
large one at Atlanta;” for he did not favor the plan of
burying the dead of the Atlanta campaign at Chattanooga.</p>

<p class='c000'>The military division, called the “Division of the Tennessee,”
which General Thomas commands, comprises the States
of Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>He did not think that in either of those States there was any
love for the Union, except in the hearts of a small minority.
Tennessee was perhaps an exception. It was the only one of
the Southern States that had reorganized on a strictly Union
basis. It had disfranchised the Rebels. The governor, the
legislature, and the recently elected members of Congress,
were unquestionably loyal men. The Rebel State debt had
been repudiated, and the Constitutional Amendment abolishing
slavery adopted. East Tennessee could take care of itself;
but in Middle and West Tennessee, where the Rebel sentiment
predominated, personal and partisan animosities were so
strong that Union men must for some time to come have the
protection of the government. There were then in Tennessee
about six thousand troops, stationed chiefly at Chattanooga,
Memphis, and Nashville, with smaller garrisons scattered
throughout the State, sufficient to remind the people
that the government still lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the freedman, General Thomas thought the respectable
classes, and especially the intelligent large planters, were
inclined to treat him with justice; but habit and prejudice
were so strong even with them, that the kind of justice he
might expect would be largely mixed with wrong and outrage,
if the Bureau was withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General was in the receipt of information, from entirely
distinct and reliable sources, concerning secret organizations
in the Southern States, the design of which was to embarrass
the Federal Government and destroy its credit, to keep alive
the fires of Rebel animosity, and to revive the cause of the
Confederacy whenever there should occur a favorable opportunity,
such as a political division of the North, or a war with
some foreign power. As his testimony on this subject has been
made public, I shall say nothing further of it here, except to
express my sense of the weight to be attached to the conclusions
of so calm and unprejudiced a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had great faith in the negro. “I may be supposed to
know something about him, for I was raised in a slave State;
and I have certainly seen enough of him during and since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>war. There is no doubt about his disposition to work and
take care of himself, now he is free.” When I spoke of the
great difference existing between different African races, he
replied, “There is more ability and fidelity in these apish-looking
negroes than you suppose”; and he proceeded to relate
the following story:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had a servant of the kind you speak of during the war.
I saw him first at a hotel in Danville, Kentucky; he waited
on me a good deal, and attracted my attention because he
looked so much like a baboon. He took a liking to me, from
some cause, and in order to be near me, engaged in the service
of one of my staff-officers. I saw him occasionally afterwards,
but gave him little attention, and had no suspicion of the romantic
attachment with which I had inspired him. At length I
had the misfortune to lose a very valuable servant, and did not
know how I should replace him: servants were plenty enough,
but I wanted one who could understand what I wished to
have done without even being told my wishes, and who would
have it done almost before I was aware of the necessity. I
happened to name these qualities of a perfect valet in the
presence of one of my aides, who said to me, ‘I have just the
man you want; and though I wouldn’t part with him for
any other cause, you shall have him.’ I accepted his offer;
and what was my surprise when he introduced to me the
baboon. I at first thought it a jest; but soon learned that
he had conferred upon me a great favor. I never had such
a servant. In a week’s time he understood perfectly all my
habits and requirements, and it was very rare I ever had to
give him a verbal order. We had difficulty in getting our
washing and ironing properly done, in the army; but one day
I noticed my linen was looking better than usual. The fellow
had anticipated my want in that respect, and learned to wash
and iron expressly to please me. He soon became one of the
best washers and ironers I ever saw; I don’t think a woman
in America could beat him. As soon as his newly acquired
art became known, it was in demand; and he asked permission
to do the linen of some of my officers, which I granted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>He was industrious and provident; he supported, a family, and,
during the three years he was with me, laid by two thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among other prominent men I saw was General Fiske, of
the Freedmen’s Bureau, Assistant-Commissioner for the States
of Tennessee and Kentucky. There were in his district six
hundred thousand freedmen. He was issuing eight hundred
rations daily to colored women and children, and three times
as many to white refugees. “During the past four years,”
said he, “between Louisville and Atlanta, we have fed with
government charity rations sixty-four white to one colored
person.” The local poor he refused to feed. “I told the
Mayor of Nashville the other day that if he did not take care
of his poor, I would assess the whiskey shops for their benefit.
There are four hundred and eighteen shops of that kind in this
city; and eighteen thousand dollars a day are poured down
the throats of the people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The colored people of Nashville had organized a provident
association managed exclusively by themselves, the object of
which was the systematic relief of the poor, irrespective of
color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the differences arising between the freedmen
and the whites, General Fiske said, “In thirteen cases out of
fifteen, the violation of contracts originates with the whites.”
Since the defeat of the Negro Testimony Bill in the legislature,
he had taken all cases, in which freedmen were concerned,
out of the civil courts, and turned them over to freedmen’s
courts, where alone justice could be done them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In my work of elevating the colored race,” said he, “I
get more hearty coöperation from intelligent and influential
Rebel slave-holders, than from the rabid Unionists of East
Tennessee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the laziness with which the negroes were
charged, he said, “They are more industrious than the whites.
You see young men standing on street corners with cigars in
their mouths, and hands in their pockets, swearing the negroes
won’t work; while they themselves are supported by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>own mothers, who keep boarding-houses. The idle colored
families complained of are usually the wives and children of
soldiers serving in the Federal army; and they have as good a
right to be idle as the wives and children of any other men
who are able and willing to support their families. In this
city, it is the negroes who do the hard work. They handle
goods on the levee and at the railroad; drive drays and
hacks; lay gas-pipes; and work on new buildings. In the
country they are leasing farms; some are buying farms; others
are at work for wages. Able-bodied plantation hands earn
fifteen and twenty dollars a month; women, ten and twelve
dollars; the oldest boy and girl in a family, five and nine dollars.
Hundreds of colored families are earning forty dollars
a month, besides their rations, quarters, medical attendance,
and the support of the younger children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The schools of General Fiske’s district, under the superintendence
of Professor Ogden, were in a promising condition.
There were near fifteen thousand pupils, and two hundred
and sixty-four teachers. Many summer schools, which for
want of school-houses were kept under trees, had been
discontinued at the coming on of winter. Rebels returning
home with their pardons were also turning the freedmen out
of buildings used as school-houses. The consequence was a
falling off of nearly one third in the number of pupils since
September.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Nashville there was a school supported by the United
Presbyterian Mission, numbering eight hundred pupils; and
another by the Pennsylvania Freedmen’s Relief Association,
numbering three hundred and fifty. The American Missionary
Association and Western Freedmen’s Aid had united in
purchasing, for sixteen thousand dollars, land on which had
been erected twenty-three government hospital buildings,
worth fifty thousand dollars, which, “by the superior management
of General Fiske,” said Professor Ogden, “have
been secured for our schools.” It was proposed to establish
in them a school, having all grades, from the primary up to
the normal. There was a great need of properly qualified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>colored teachers to send into by-places; which this school was
designed to supply.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Fiske had introduced a system of plantation schools,
which was working well. Benevolent societies furnished the
teachers, and planters were required to furnish the school-houses.
A plantation of one hundred and fifty hands and
forty or fifty children would have its own school-house.
Smaller plantations would unite and build a school-house in
some central location. These conditions were generally put
into the contracts with the planters, who were beginning to
learn that there was nothing so encouraging and harmonizing
to the freedmen as the establishment of schools for their children.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I left Nashville for Decatur on a morning of dismal rain
The cars were crowded and uncomfortable, with many passengers
standing. The railroad was sadly short of rolling-stock,
having (like most Southern roads) only such as
happened to be on it when it was turned over to the directors
by the government. It owned but three first-class cars, only
one of which we had with us. The rest of the passenger
train was composed of box-cars supplied with rude seats.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed the forts of the city; passed the battle-ground
of Franklin, with its fine rolling fields, marked by entrenchments;
and speeding on through a well-wooded handsome
section of country, entered Northern Alabama. As my observations
of that portion of the State will be of a general
character, I postpone them until I shall come to speak of the
State at large.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was raining again when I left Decatur, ferried across the
Tennessee in a barge manned by negroes. Of the railroad
bridge burned by General Mitchell, only the high stone piers
remained; and freight and passengers had to be conveyed
over the river in that way. I remember a black ferryman
whose stalwart form and honest speech interested me, and
whose testimony with regard to his condition I thought worth
noting down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I works for my old master. He raised me. He’s a right
kind master. I gits twenty dollars a month, and he finds me.
Some of the masters about hyere is right tight on our people.
Then thar’s a heap of us that won’t work, and that steal from
the rest. They’re my own color, but I can’t help saying
what’s true. They just set right down, thinking they’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>free, and waiting for luck to come to ’em.” But he assured
me that the most of his people were at work, and doing well.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the miserable little ferry-boat we were landed on the
other side in the midst of a drenching rain. To reach the cars
there was a steep muddy bank to climb. The baggage was
brought up in wagons and pitched down into mud several
inches deep, where passengers had to stand in the pouring
shower and see to getting their checks.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the road to Tuscumbia I made the acquaintance of a
young South Carolinian, whose character enlisted my sympathy,
and whose candid conversation offers some points worth
heeding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think it was in the decrees of God Almighty that slavery
was to be abolished in this way; and I don’t murmur. We
have lost our property, and we have been subjugated, but we
brought it all on ourselves. Nobody that hasn’t experienced
it knows anything about our suffering. We are discouraged:
we have nothing left to begin new with. I never did a day’s
work in my life, and don’t know how to begin. You see me
in these coarse old clothes; well, I never wore coarse clothes in
my life before the war.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the negroes: “We can’t feel towards them as
you do; I suppose we ought to, but ’t isn’t possible for us.
They’ve always been our owned servants, and we’ve been
used to having them mind us without a word of objection, and
we can’t bear anything else from them now. If that’s wrong,
we’re to be pitied sooner than blamed, for it’s something we
can’t help. I was always kind to my slaves. I never whipped
but two boys in my life, and one of them I whipped three
weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When he was a free man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; for I tell you that makes no difference in our
feeling towards them. I sent a boy across the country for
some goods. He came back with half the goods he ought to
have got for the money. I may as well be frank,—it was a
gallon of whiskey. There were five gentlemen at the house,
and I wanted the whiskey for them. I told Bob he stole it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Afterwards he came into the room and stood by the door,—a
big, strong fellow, twenty-three years old. I said, ‘Bob,
what do you want?’ He said, ‘I want satisfaction about the
whiskey.’ He told me afterwards, he meant that he wasn’t
satisfied I should think he had stolen it, and wanted to come
to a good understanding about it. But I thought he wanted
satisfaction gentlemen’s fashion. I rushed for my gun. I’d
have shot him dead on the spot if my friends hadn’t held me.
They said I’d best not kill him, but that he ought to be
whipped. I sent to the stable for a trace, and gave him a
hundred and thirty with it, hard as I could lay on. I confess
I did whip him unmercifully.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did he make no resistance?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, he knew better than that; my friends stood by to see
me through. I was wrong, I know, but I was in a passion.
That’s the way we treat our servants, and shall treat them,
until we can get used to the new order of things,—if we ever
can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the mean while, according to your own showing, it
would seem that some restraint is necessary for you, and some
protection for the negroes. On the whole, the Freedmen’s
Bureau is a good thing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled: “May be it is; yes, if the nigger is to be free,
I reckon it is; but it’s a mighty bitter thing for us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, speaking of secession: “I had never thought much
about politics, though I believed our State was right when she
went out. But when the bells were ringing, and everybody
was rejoicing that she had seceded, a solemn feeling came over
me, like I had never had in my life, and I couldn’t help feeling
there was something wrong. I went through the war;
there were thousands like me. In our hearts we thought
more of the Stars and Stripes than we did of the old rag we
were fighting under.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was going to Mississippi to look after some property left
there before the war. But what he wished to do was to go
North: “only I know I wouldn’t be tolerated,—I know a
man couldn’t succeed in business there, who was pointed out
as a Rebel.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>The same wish, qualified by the same apprehension, was
frequently expressed to me by the better class of young Southern
men; and I always took pains to convince them that they
would be welcomed and encouraged by all enlightened communities
in the Northern States.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a dismal night in the cars. The weather changed,
and it grew suddenly very cold. Now the stove was red hot;
and now the fire was out, with both car-doors wide open at
some stopping-place.</p>

<p class='c000'>At two in the morning we reached Corinth. A driver put
me into his hack, and drove about town, through the freezing
mud, to find me a lodging. The hotels were full. The
boarding-houses were full,—all but one, in which, with a
fellow-traveller, I was fortunate enough at last to find a room
with two beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a large, lofty room, the door fifteen feet high from
the floor, the walls eighteen feet. It had been an elegant
apartment once; but now the windows were broken, the
plastering and stucco-work disfigured, the laths smashed in
places, there were bullet-holes through the walls, and large
apertures in the wainscots. The walls were covered with devices,
showing that Federal soldiers had been at home there;
such as a shield, admirably executed, bearing the motto:
“The Union, it must be preserved”; “Heaven Bless our
Native Land”; “God of Battles, speed the Right”; and so
forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beds were tumbled, some travellers having just got out
of them to take the train. A black woman came in to make
them. The lady of the house also came in,—a fashionably
bred Southern woman, who had been reduced, by the fortunes
of the Rebellion, from the condition of a helpless mistress of
many servants, to that of a boarding-house keeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked for a single room, which I was somewhat curtly told
I couldn’t have. I then asked for more bedclothes,—for
the weather continued to grow cold, and the walls of the room
offered little protection against it. She said, “I reckon you’re
mighty particular!” I replied that she was quite correct in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>her reckoning, and insisted on the additional clothing. At
last I got it, very fortunately; for my room-mate, who did
not make the same demand, nearly froze in the other bed before
daylight.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning a black man came in and made a fire. Then,
before I was up, a black girl came in to bring a towel, and to
break the ice in the wash-basin. That the water might not
freeze again before I could use it, (for the fire, as some one
has said, “couldn’t get a purchase on the cold,”) I requested
her to place the basin on the hearth; also to shut the door;
for every person who passed in or out left all doors wide, affording
a free passage from my bed to the street.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re cold-natered, an’t ye?” said the girl, to whose
experience my modest requests appeared unprecedented.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards I went out to breakfast in a room that showed
no chimney, and no place for a stove. The outer door was
open much of the time, and when it was shut the wind came
in through a great round hole cut for the accommodation of
cats and dogs. This, be it understood, was a fashionable
Southern residence; and this had always been the dining-room,
in winter the same as in summer, though no fire had
ever been built in it. The evening before, the lady had said
to me, “The Yankees are the cause that we have no better
accommodations to offer you,” and I had cheerfully forgiven
her. But the Yankees were not the cause of our breakfasting
in such a bleak apartment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody at table was pinched and blue. The lady, white
and delicate, sat wrapped in shawls. She was very bitter
against the Yankees, until I smilingly informed her that her
remarks were particularly interesting to me, as I was a Yankee
myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From what State are you, Sir?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“From Massachusetts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!”—with a shudder,—“they’re bad Yankees!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bad enough, Heaven knows,” I pleasantly replied;
“though, in truth, Madam, I have seen almost as bad people
in other parts of the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>The lady’s husband changed the conversation by offering
me a piece of venison which he had killed the day before.
Deer were plenty in that region. As in Tennessee and Alabama,
game of all kinds—deer, foxes, wild turkeys, wolves,—had
increased greatly in Mississippi during the war; the inhabitants
having had something more formidable to hunt, or been
hunted themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. M—— owned two abandoned plantations: this was his
town residence. He left it just before the battle of Shiloh,
and it was occupied either by the Rebels or Yankees till the
end of the war. He was originally opposed to the secession-leaders,
but he afterwards went into the war, and lost everything,
while they kept out of it and made money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet-holes in the house were made by the Rebels
firing at the Federals when they attacked the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>The family consisted of three persons,—Mr. M——, his
wife, and their little boy. Notwithstanding their poverty,
they kept four black servants to wait upon them. They were
paying a man fifteen dollars a month, a cook-woman the same,
another woman six, and a girl six: total, forty-two dollars. It
was mainly to obtain money to pay and feed these people that
they had been compelled to take in lodgers. The possibility
of getting along with fewer servants seemed never to have
occurred to them. Before the war they used to keep seven
or eight. It was the old wasteful habit of slavery: masters
were accustomed to have many servants about them, and
each servant must have two or three to help him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen, I was told, were behaving very well. But
the citizens were bitterly hostile to the negro garrison which
then occupied Corinth. A respectable white man had recently
been killed by a colored soldier, and the excitement occasioned
by the circumstance was intense. It was called “a cold-blooded
murder.” Visiting head-quarters, I took pains to ascertain the
facts in the case. They are in brief as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The said respectable citizen was drunk. Going down the
street, he staggered against a colored orderly. Cursing him,
he said, “Why don’t you get out of the way when you see a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>white man coming?” The orderly replied, “There’s room
for you to pass.” The respectable citizen then drew his revolver,
threatening to “shoot his damned black heart out.”
This occasioned an order for his arrest. He drew his revolver,
with a similar threat, upon another soldier sent to take him,
and was promptly shot down by him. Exit respectable citizen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Corinth is a bruised and battered village surrounded by
stumpy fields, forts, earthworks, and graves. The stumpy
fields are the sites of woods and groves cut away by the great
armies. The graves are those of soldiers slain upon these hills.
Beautiful woody boundaries sweep round all.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is nothing about the town especially worth visiting;
and my object in stopping there was to make an excursion into
the country and visit the battle-field of Shiloh. I went to a
livery-stable to engage a horse. I was told of frequent robberies
that had been committed on that road, and urged by
the stable-keeper to take a man with me; but I wished to
make the acquaintance of the country people, and thought I
could do better without a companion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLI.<br /> <span class='large'>ON HORSEBACK FROM CORINTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mounting a sober little iron-gray, I cantered out of Corinth,
in a northeasterly direction, past the angles of an old fort
overgrown with weeds, and entered the solitary wooded country
beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short ride brought me to a broken bridge, hanging its
shaky rim over a stream breast-high to my horse. I paused
on its brink, dubious; until I saw two ladies, coming to town
on horseback to do their shopping (the fashion of the country),
rein boldly down the muddy bank, gather their skirts together,
hold up their heels, and take like ducks to the water. I held
up my heels and did likewise. This was the route of the
great armies; which whoso follows will find many a ruined
bridge and muddy stream to ford.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a clear, crisp winter’s morning. The air was elastic
and sparkling. The road wound among lofty trunks of oak,
poplar, hickory, and gum, striped and gilded with the slanting
early sunshine. Quails (called partridges in the South) flew
up from the wayside; turtle-doves flitted from the limbs above
my head; the woodpeckers screamed and tapped, greeting my
approach with merry fife and drum. Cattle were grazing on
the wild grass of the woods, and a solitary cow-bell rang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two and a half miles from town I came to a steam saw-mill,
all about which the forest resounded with the noise of axes,
the voices of negroes shouting to their teams, the flapping of
boards thrown down, and the vehement buzz of the saw.
This mill had but recently gone into operation; being one of
hundreds that had already been brought from the North, and
set to work supplying the demand for lumber, and repairing
the damages of war.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Near by was a new house of rough logs with the usual great
opening through it. It was situated in the midst of ruins
which told too plain a story. Tying my horse to a bush, I
entered, and found one division of the house occupied by negro
servants, the other by two lonely white women. One
of these was young; the other aged, and bent with grief and
years. She sat by the fire, knitting, wrapped in an ancient
shawl, and having a white handkerchief tied over her head.
The walls and roof were full of chinks, the wind blew through
the room, and she crouched shivering over the hearth.</p>

<p class='c000'>She offered me a chair, and a negro woman, from the other
part of the house, brought in wood, which she heaped in the
great open fireplace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sit up, stranger,” said the old lady. “I haven’t
the accommodations for guests I had once; but you’re
welcome to what I have. I owned a beautiful place here
before the war,—a fine house, negro quarters, an orchard,
and garden, and everything comfortable. The Yankees came
along and destroyed it. They didn’t leave me a fence,—not
a rail nor a pale. If I had stayed here, they wouldn’t have
injured me, and I should have saved my house; but I was
advised to leave. I have come back here to spend my days in
this cabin. I lost everything, even my clothes; and I’m too
old to begin life again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Myself a Yankee, what could I say to console her?</p>

<p class='c000'>A mile and a half farther on, I came to another log-house,
and stopped to inquire my way of an old man standing by the
gate. His countenance was hard and stern, and he eyed me,
as I thought, with a sinister expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are a stranger in this country?” I told him I was.
“I allow you’re from the North?”—eying me still more
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” I replied; “I am from New England.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m glad to see ye. Alight. It’s a right cool morning:
come into the house and warm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I confess to a strong feeling of distrust, as I looked at him.
I resolved, however, to accept his invitation. He showed me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>into a room, which appeared to be the kitchen and sleeping-room
of a large family. Two young women and several children
were crowded around the fireplace, while the door of
the house was left wide open, after the fashion of doors in the
South country. There was something stewing in a skillet on
the hearth; which I noticed, because the old man, as he sat
and talked with me, spat his tobacco-juice over it (not always
with accuracy) at the back-log. I remarked that the country
appeared very quiet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quiet, to what it was,” said the old man, with a wicked
twinkle of the eye. “You’ve probably heard of some of the
murders and robberies through here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I had heard of some such irregularities.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve been robbed time and again. I’ve had nine horses
and mules stole.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By whom?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bushwhackers. They’ve been here to kill me three
or four times; but, as it happened, the killing was on t’ other
side.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who were these men?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some on ’em belonged in Massissippi, and some on ’em in
Tennessy. They come to my house of a Tuesday night, last
Feb’uary. They rode up to the house, and surrounded it, a
dozen or fifteen of ’em. ‘Old Lee!’ they shouted, ‘we want
ye!’ It had been cloudy ’arly in the evening, but it had
fa’red up, and as I looked out thro’ the chinks in the logs, I
could see ’em moving around.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Come out, Old Lee! we’ve business with ye!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You’ve no honest business this hour o’ the night,’ I
says.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Come out, or we’ll fire your house.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Stand back, then,’ I says, ‘while I open the doo’.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“I opened it a crack, but instead of going out, I just put
out the muzzle of my gun, and let have at the fust man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Boys! I’m shot!’ he says. I’d sent a slug plumb
thro’ his body. Whilst the others was getting him away, I
loaded up again. In a little while they come back, mad as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>devils. I didn’t wait for ’em to order me out, but fired as
they come up to the doo’. I hit one of ’em in the thigh.
After that they went off, and I didn’t hear any more of ’em
that night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What became of the wounded men?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The one I shot thro’ the body got well. The other
died.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you learn?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They was all neighbors of mine. They lived only a few
miles from here, over the Tennessy line. That was Tuesday
night; and the next Sunday night the gang come again. I
was prepared for ’em. I had cut a trap through the floo’;
and I had my grandson with me, a boy about twelve year old;
and he had a gun. We’d just got comfortably to bed, when
some men rode up to the gate, and hollah’d, “Hello!” several
times. I told my wife to ask ’em what they wanted. They
said they was strangers, and had lost their road and wanted
the man of the house to come out. I drapped thro’ the hole
in the floo’, and told my wife to tell ’em I wa’n’t in the house,
and they must go somewhar else.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’We’ll see if he’s in the house,’ they said. The house
is all open underneath, and I reckoned I’d a good position;
but befo’e I got a chance at ary one, they’d bust in. They
went to rummaging, and threatening my wife, and skeering the
children. I could hear ’em tramping over my head; till bimeby
the clock struck; and I heerd one of ’em sw’ar, ‘Ten
o’clock, and nary dollar yet!’ After that, I could see ’em
outside the house; hunting around for me, as I allowed. I
fired on one. ‘My God!’ I heered him say, ‘he’s killed
me!’ I then took my grandson’s gun, and fired again. Such
a rushing and scampering you never heered. They run off,
leaving one of their men lying dead right out here before the
doo’. We found him thar the next morning. He laid thar
nigh on to two days, when some of his friends come and took
him and buried him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did those men wish to murder you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They had a spite agin me, because they said I was a Union
man.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“They called him a Yankee,” said one of the young
women.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you are not a Yankee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was born in Tennessy, and have lived either in Tennessy
or Massissippi all my days. But I never was a secessioner; I
went agin the war; and I had two son-in-law’s in the Federal
army. Both these girls’ husbands was fighting the Rebels, and
that’s what made ’em hate me. They was determined to kill
me; and after that last attempt on my life, I refugeed. I went
to the Yankees, and didn’t come back till the war wound up.
There’s scoundrels watching for a chance to bushwhack me
now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Old Lee’d go up mighty quick, if they wa’n’t afeared,”
remarked one of the daughters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m on hand for ’em,” said the old man,—and now I
understood that wicked sparkle of his eye. “Killing is good
for ’em. A lead bullet is better for getting rid of ’em than any
amount of silver or gold, and a heap cheaper!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Two miles north of Old Lee’s I came to the State boundary.
While I was still in Mississippi, I saw, just over the line, in
Tennessee, a wild figure of a man riding on before me. He
was mounted on a raw-boned mule, and wore a flapping gray
blanket which gave him a fantastic appearance. The old
hero’s story had set me thinking of bushwhackers, and I half
fancied this solitary horseman—or rather mule-man—to be
one of that amiable gentry. He had pursued me from Corinth,
and passed me unwittingly while I was sitting in Old Lee’s
kitchen. He was riding fast to overtake me. Or perhaps he
was only an innocent country fellow returning from town. I
switched on, and soon came near enough to notice that the
mule’s tail was fancifully clipped and trimmed to resemble a
rope with a tassel at the end of it; also that the rider’s face
was mysteriously muffled in a red handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was almost at his side, when hearing voices in the woods
behind me, I looked around, and saw two more mounted men
coming after us at a swift gallop. The thought flashed through
my mind that those were the fellow’s accomplices. One to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>one had not seemed to me very formidable; but three to one
would not be so pleasant. I pressed my iron gray immediately
alongside the tassel-tailed mule, and accosted the rider, determined
to learn what manner of man he was before the others
arrived. The startled look he gave me, and the blue nose,
with its lucid pendent drop, that peered out of the sanguinary
handkerchief, showed me that he was as harmless a traveller
as myself. He was a lad about eighteen years of age. He
had tied up his ears, to defend them from the cold, and the
bandage over them had prevented him from hearing my approach
until I was close upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a kule day,” he remarked, with numb lips, as he
reined his mule aside to let me pass at a respectful distance,—for
it was evident he regarded me with quite as much distrust
as I had him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time the two other mounted men came rushing
upon us, through the half-frozen puddles, with splash and
clatter and loud boisterous oaths; and one of them drew from
his pocket, and brandished over the tossing mane of his horse,
something so like a pistol that I half expected a shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How are ye?” said he, halting his horse, and spattering
me all over with muddy water. “Right cold morning! Hello,
Zeek!” to the rider of the tassel-tailed mule. “I didn’t
know ye, with yer face tied up that fashion. Take a drink?”
Zeek declined. “Take a drink, stranger?” And he offered
me the pistol, which proved to be a flask of whiskey. I declined
also. Upon which the fellow held the flask unsteadily
to his own lips for some seconds, then passed it to his companion.
After drinking freely, they spurred on again, with
splash and laughter and oaths, leaving Zeek and me riding
alone together.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLII.<br /> <span class='large'>ZEEK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t I see your horse tied to Old Lee’s gate?” said
Zeek. And that led to a discussion of the old hero’s character.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is he a Union man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I kain’t say; but that’s the story they tell on him. One
of the men he killed was one of our neighbors; a man we
used to consider right respectable; but he tuke to thieving
during the wa’, and got to be of no account. That was the
way with a many I know. You may stop at a house now
whur they’ll steal your horse, and like as not rob and murder
ye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek told me he lived on the edge of the battle-field; and I
engaged him to guide me to it. He thought I must be going
to search for the body of some friend who fell there. When
I told him I was from the North, and that my object was
simply to visit the battle-field, he looked at me with amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should think you’d be afraid to be riding alone in this
country! If ’t was known you was a Yankee, and had
money about you, I allow you’d get a shot from behind some
bush.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think the men who would serve me such a trick are very
few.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thar was right smart of ’em befo’e the wa’ closed. They’d
just go about robbing,—hang an old gray-haired man right
up, till he’d tell whur his money was. They called themselves
Confederates, but they was just robbers. They’ve got
killed off, or have gone off, or run out, till, as you say, there
an’t but few left.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>With these exceptions, Zeek praised highly the middling
class of people who inhabited that region.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some countries, a pore man ain’t respected no mo’e ’n a
dog. ‘Tan’t so hyere. Man may be plumb pore, but if he’s
honest, he’s thought as much of as anybody. Mo’e ’n two
thirds of ’em can read and write.” Before the war, they used
to have what they called “neighborhood schools.” The
teacher was supported by the pupils, receiving two dollars a
month for each: he taught only in winter, and was fortunate
if he could secure forty pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flocks of sparrows flew up from the bushes or hopped along
the ground. There were bluebirds also; and I noticed one
or two robins. “We never see robins hyere only in winter,”
said Zeek.</p>

<p class='c000'>Green bunches of mistletoe grew on the leafless brown trees,—a
striking feature of Southern woods in winter. “It’s a
curiosity, the way it grows,” said Zeek. “It just grows on
the tops of trees, without no rute, nor nothing. It’s a rare
chance you find it on the hills; it grows mostly on the bottoms
whur thar’s mo’e moisture in the air.” It was a beautiful
sight to me, riding under its verdant tufts, sometimes so low
on the boughs that, by rising in the stirrups, I could pluck
sprigs of it, with their translucent pearly berries, as I passed.
But Zeek was wrong in saying it had no root. It is supposed
to be propagated by birds wiping their bills upon the limbs of
trees, after eating the berries. A stray seed thus deposited
germinates, and the penetrating root feeds upon the juices that
flow between the bark and the wood of the tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed but few farm-houses, and those were mostly built
of logs. We crossed heavy lines of Beauregard’s breastworks;
and could have traced the route of the great armies by the
bones of horses, horned cattle, and mules we saw whitening in
the woods and by the roadside. A crest of hilly fields showed
us a magnificent sweep of level wooded country on the west
and south, like a brown wavy sea, with tossed tree-tops for
breakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mighty pore soil along hyere,” observed Zeek. When I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>told him that it was as good as much of the soil of New
England, which farmers never thought of cultivating without
using manures, he said, “When our land gits as pore as that,
we just turn it right out, and cle’r again. We don’t allow we
can afford to manure. But No’th Car’linians come in hyere,
and take up the land turned out so, and go to manuring it,
and raise right smart truck on it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was inclined to ride faster than Zeek, he looked critically
at my horse, and remarked, “I don’t reckon you give
less ’n a dollar a day for that beast.” I said I gave more than
that. “I ride my beasts hard enough,” he replied, “but I
reckon if I paid a dollar a day for one, I’d ride him a heap
harder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been down to the saw-mill, to get pay for a yoke of
oxen his father had sold. “I started by sun-up, and got thar
agin nine o’clock.” It was now afternoon, and he was hungry
and cold. He therefore proposed to me to go home with him
and get warm, before visiting the battle-field.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was after two o’clock when we came to a hilly field covered
with rotting clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beauregard’s troops come plumb up this road, and slept
hyere the night befo’e the battle. They left their blankets and
knapsacks, and after they got brushed out by the Yankees,
the second day, they didn’t wait to pick ’em up again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We entered the woods beyond, directing our course towards
the western edge of the battle-field; and, after riding some
distance, forded Owl Creek,—a narrow, but deep and muddy
stream. Zeek’s home was in view from the farther bank; a
log-house, with the usual great opening through the middle;
situated on the edge of a pleasant oak-grove strewn with rustling
leaves, and enclosed, with its yard and out-houses, by a
Virginia rail-fence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIII.<br /> <span class='large'>ZEEK’S FAMILY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Alight!” said Zeek, dismounting at the gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remonstrated against leaving the animals uncovered in the
cold, but he said it was the way people did in that country;
and it was not until an hour later that he found it convenient
to give them shelter and food.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were met inside the gate by a sister of the young
man’s, a girl of fifteen, in a native Bloomer dress that fell
just below the knees. As I entered the space between the
two divisions of the house, I noticed that doors on both sides
were open, one leading to the kitchen, where there was a
great fire, and the other to the sitting-room, where there was
another great fire, in large old-fashioned fireplaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek took me into the sitting-room, and introduced me to
his mother. There were two beds in the back corners of the
room. The uncovered floor was of oak; the naked walls
were of plain hewn logs; the sleepers and rough boards of
the chamber floor constituted the ceiling. There were clothes
drying on a pole stretched across the room, and hanks of dyed
cotton thread on a bayonet thrust into a chink of the chimney.
Cold as the day was, the door by which we entered was never
shut, and sometimes another door was open, letting the wintry
wind sweep through the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek’s mother went to see about getting us some dinner;
and his father came in from the woods, where he had been
chopping, and sat in the chimney-corner and talked with me:
a lean, bent, good-humored, hard-working, sensible sort of
man. He told me he had five hundred acres of land, but
only thirty-six under cultivation. He and Zeek did the work;
they had never owned negroes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“Three or four niggers is too much money for a pore man
to invest in that way: they may lie down and die, and then
whur’s yer money? Thar was five niggers owned in Middle
Tennessy,” he added, “to one in this part of the State.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of his farm, he said it was mighty good land till
it wore out. He had raised two bales of cotton on three and
a half acres, the past season. It was equally good for other
crops. “I make some corn, some pork, some cotton, and a
mule or two, every year: I never resk all on one thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking at the open outside doors and the great roaring
fires, I said I should think wood must be a very important
item with Tennessee farmers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I reckon we burn two cords a week, such weather
as this, just for fire, and as much more in the kitchen. We’ve
wood enough. As we turn out old land, we must cle’r new;
then we have the advantage of the ashes for ley and soap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the labor of chopping so much wood must be considerable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I can chop enough in a day, or a day and a half, to
last a week. Winters, farmers don’t do much else but feed
and get wood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I thought they would some day regret not having
kept up their cleared fields by proper cultivation, and preserved
their forests.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I allow we shall. I’ve just returned from a trip up into
Middle Tennessy” (accented on the first syllable), “whur
I used to live; they burnt up their timber thar, just as we’re
doing hyere, and now they’re setting down and grieving because
they’ve no wood. They save everything thar, to the
trunks and crotches. We just leave them to rot, or log ’em
up in heaps and burn ’em, whur the land’s to be cle’red;
and use only the clean limbs, that chop easy and don’t require
much splitting.” He broke forth in praise of a good warm
fire. “Put on a big green back-log and build agin it,—that’s
our fashion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek’s mother came to announce our dinner. I crossed the
open space, pausing only to wash my hands and face in a tin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>basin half filled with water and pieces of ice, and entered the
kitchen. It was a less pretentious apartment than the sitting-room.
There was no window in it; but wide chinks between
the logs, and two open doors, let in a sufficiency of daylight,
and more than a sufficiency of cold wind. There was a bed in
one corner, and a little square pine table set in the centre of
the room. A gourd of salt hung by the chimney, and a homemade
broom leaned beside it. I noticed a scanty supply of
crockery and kitchen utensils on pegs and shelves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The table was neatly set, with a goodly variety of dishes for
a late dinner in a back-country farm-house. I remember a
plate of fried pork; fricasseed gray squirrel (cold); boiled
“back of hog” (warmed up); a pitcher of milk; cold biscuit,
cold corn bread, and “sweet bread” (a name given to a
plain sort of cake).</p>

<p class='c000'>We could have dined very comfortably but for the open
doors. Blowing in at one and out at the other, and circulating
through numberless cracks between the logs, the gale
frisked at will about our legs, and made our very hands numb
and noses cold while we ate. The fire was of no more use
to us than one built out-of-doors. The victuals that had
come upon the table warm were cold before they reached our
mouths. The river of pork-fat which the kind lady poured
over my plate, congealed at once into a brownish-gray deposit,
like a spreading sand-bar. I enjoyed an advantage over Zeek,
for I had taken the precaution to put on my overcoat and to
secure a back seat. He sat opposite me, with his back towards
the windward door, where the blast, pouncing in upon
him, pierced and pinched him without mercy. He had not
yet recovered from the chill of his long winter-day’s ride; and
his lank, shivering frame, and blue, narrow, puckered face
under its thin thatch of tow (combed straight down, and cut
square and short across his forehead from ear to ear), presented
a picture at once astonishing and ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you got warm yet, Zeek?” I cheerfully inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No!”—shuddering. “I’m plumb chilly! I’m so kule
I kain’t eat.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“I should think you would be more comfortable with that
door closed,” I mildly suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>He slowly turned his head half round, and as slowly turned
it back again, with another shiver. The possibility of actually
shutting the door seemed scarcely to penetrate the tow-thatch.
I suppose such an act would have been unprecedented in that
country,—one which all conservative persons would have
shaken their heads at as a dangerous innovation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek begged to be excused, he was so kule; and taking a
piece of squirrel in one hand, and a biscuit in the other, went
and stood by the fire. I found that he was averse to going
out again that day: it was now late in the afternoon, and our
poor animals had not yet been fed, or even taken in from where
they stood curled up with the cold by the gate: I accordingly
proposed to the old folks to spend the night with them, and
to take Zeek with me over the battle-field in the morning.
This being agreed upon, the father invited me to go out and
see his stock, and his two bags of cotton.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the yard near the house was the smoke-house, or meat-house,
a blind hut built of small logs, answering the purpose
of a cellar,—for in that country cellars are unknown. In it
the family provisions were stored. Under an improvised shelter
at one corner was the cotton, neatly packed in two bales of
five hundred pounds each, and looking handsome as a lady in
its brown sacking and new hoops. The hoops were a sort
of experiment, which it was thought would prove successful.
Usually the sacking and ropes about a bale of cotton cost as
much by the pound as the cotton itself; and, to economize
that expense, planters were beginning to substitute hickory
hoops for ropes. The owner was very proud of those two
bales, picked by his own hands and his children’s, and prepared
for market at a gin and press in the neighborhood; and
he hoped to realize five hundred dollars for them when thrown
upon the market. A planter of a thousand bales, made by
the hands of slaves he was supposed to own, and ginned and
pressed on his own plantation, could not have contemplated his
crop with greater satisfaction, in King Cotton’s haughtiest days.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Near the meat-house was a huge ash-leach. Then there was
a simple horse-mill for crushing sorghum,—for Mr. ——, like
most Southern farmers, made sufficient syrup for home consumption,
besides a little for market. Under a beech-tree was
a beautiful spring of water. A rail-fence separated the door-yard
from the cattle-yard, where were flocks of hens, geese,
ducks, and turkeys, cackling, quacking, and gobbling in such
old familiar fashion that I was made to feel strangely at home
in their company. There were bleating, hungry calves, and
good-natured surly bulls, and patient cows waiting to be milked
and fed, and a family of uncurried colts and young mules, and
beautiful spotted goats, with their kids, and near by a hog-lot
frill of lean and squealing swine. Speaking of the goats,
Mr. —— said there was no money in them, but that he kept
them for the curiosity of the thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no barn on the place. The nearest approach to
it was the stable, or “mule-pen,” constructed of logs with liberal
openings between them, through one of which my lonesome
iron-gray put his nose as I came near, and whinnied his
humble petition for fodder. There he was, stabled with mules,
unblanketed, and scarcely better off than when tied to the
gate-post,—for the wind circulated almost as freely through
the rude enclosure as it did in Mrs. ——’s kitchen. Such hospitalities
were scarcely calculated to soothe the feelings of a
proud and well-bred horse; but the iron-gray accepted them
philosophically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is your hay?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We make no hay in this country. Our stock feeds out on
the hills, or browses in the woods or cane-brakes, all winter.
When we have to feed ’em, we throw out a little corn, fodder,
and shucks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A loft over the mule-pen was filled with stalks and unhusked
corn. Zeek went up into it, and threw down bundles of the
former, and filled baskets of the latter, for his father to feed
out to the multitude of waiting mouths.</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired particularly regarding the large quantities of natural
manures which ought to accumulate in such a farm-yard.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“We just throw them out, and let them get trampled and
washed away. We can’t haul out and spread. It’s the hardest
work we ever did, and Tennesseans can’t get used to it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The yard was on a side hill, where every rain must wash it,
and the mule-pen was conveniently situated near the brink
of a gully, from which every freshet would sweep what was
thrown into it. In vain I remonstrated against this system of
farming: Mr. —— replied that he was brought up to it, and
could not learn another.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br /> <span class='large'>A NIGHT IN A TENNESSEE FARM-HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We went into the house, and gathered around the sitting-room
fire for a social evening’s talk. As it grew dark, the doors
were closed, and we sat in the beautiful firelight. And now
I learned a fact, and formed a theory, concerning doors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact was this: not a door on the premises had either
lock or bolt. Mule-pen, meat-house, and both divisions of the
dwelling-house, were left every night without other fastening
than the rude wooden latches of the country. This was a
very common practice among the small farmers of that region.
“It was a rare chance we ever used to hear of anything being
stolen. My house was never robbed, and I never lost a mule
or piece of meat till after war broke out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The closing of the doors at dark, not because the weather
had grown colder, but apparently because there was no longer
any daylight to admit, suggested to my mind the origin of the
universal Southern custom of leaving doors open during the
severest winter weather. The poor whites and negroes live
very generally in huts and cabins without windows. Even
the houses of the well-to-do small farmers are scantily supplied
with these modern luxuries. The ancestors of the wealthier
middle class dwelt not many years ago in similar habitations.
Such is the strength of habit, and so strong the conservatism
of imitative mankind, that I suppose a public statute
would be necessary to compel now the shutting of doors of
windowed houses against the piercing winds of the cold season;
just as, according to Charles Lamb, the Chinese people’s
method of obtaining roast pig by burning their dwellings over
a tender suckling—that ravishing delicacy having been accidentally
discovered to the world by the conflagration of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>house with its adjoining pig-sty—had to be stopped by an
imperial edict.</p>

<p class='c000'>We sat without lamp or candle in the red gleaming firelight;
and the faces of the little girls, who had been shrinking
and shivering with the cold all day, took on a glow of comfort
and pleasure, now that the house was shut. However, I could
still feel gusts of the wintry air blowing upon me from openings
between the logs. I have been in many Southern farm-houses;
and I have heard the custom of open doors commended
as necessary to give plenty of air and to toughen the
inmates by wholesome exposure; but I do not now remember
the habitation that was not more than sufficiently supplied with
air, both for ventilating and toughening purposes, with every
door closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. —— talked quite sensibly of the origin and results of
the war. He and the majority of the farmers in that region
were originally Union men, and remained so to the last. “Some
of the hottest secesh, too, got to be right good Union before
the wa’ was over,—they found the Yankees treated ’em so
much better ’n they expected, and the Rebs so much wuss.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He accepted emancipation. “The way I look at it, the
thing had growed up till it got ripe, and it fell on us in this
age. It was the universal opinion before the wa’, that the
country would be a heap better off without niggers. But we
couldn’t go with the Abolitionists of the No’th, nor with the
secesh fire-eaters. We stood as it were between two fires.
That was what made it so hard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But he shared the common prejudice against permitting the
negroes to remain and enjoy the land. “’T won’t do to have
’em settled among us. ’T would, if everybody was honest.
But the whites, I’m ashamed to say it, will just prey upon
them. They’re bound to be the poorest set of vagabonds that
ever walked the earth. O yes, they’ll work. It’s just this
way,—they’ll work if they have encouragement; and no
man will without, unless he’s driven. All around hyere, and
up in Middle Tennessy, whur I’ve been, they’re doing right
smart. But it has seemed to bear on their minds that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>wanted to rent land, and have a little place of their own.
They get treated right rough by some unprincipled men, and
by some that ought to know how to give ’em Christian treatment,
now they’re free. But the truth is, a white man can’t
take impudence from ’em. It may be a long ways removed
from what you or I would think impudence, but these passionate
men call it that, and pitch in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blair, an old nigger down to the saw-mill whur I went
to-day,” said Zeek, “got his head split open with an axe by a
man two days ago. He said Old Blair sassed him. He fell
plumb crossways of the fire, and they had to roll him off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the way,” said Mr. ——. “Befo’e the wa’ the
owner of the nigger’d have had the man arrested. He was
so much property. It was as if you should kill or maim my
horse. But now the nigger has no protection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s very true, if the government does not protect
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We talked of the depredations of the two armies. “I never
feared one party more than the other,” said Mrs. ——. “If
anything, the Rebels was worst.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Both took hosses and mules,” said Mr. ——. “At fust,
I used to try to get my property back. I’d go to head-quarters
and get authority to take it whur I could find it; but
always by that time ’t would be hocus-pocussed out of the way.
It was all an understood thing. Aside from that, the regular
armies, neither of them, didn’t steal from us. But as soon
as they’d passed, then the thieves would come in. They’d
take what we had, and cus us for not having mo’e. Sheep,
chickens, geese, corn, watches, and money,—whatever they
could lay hands on suffered. Men never thought of carrying
money about them, them times, but always give it to the weemun
to hide. Thar was scouts belonging to both armies, but
which was mo’e robbers than scouts, that was the scourge of
the country. If a man had anything, they’d be sure to h’ist
it. They’d pretend to come with an order to search for
gov’ment arms. It was only an excuse for robbing. They’d
search for gov’ment arms in a tin-cup. They had what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>they called a cash rope. That was a rope to slip about a
man’s neck, and swing him up with, till he’d tell whur his
money was. They had a gimblet, which they said was for
boring for treasures; and they always knew just whur to
bore to find ’em. That was right hyere” (in a man’s temples).
“They’d bore into him, till he couldn’t stand the
pain, then if he had any money he’d be only too glad to give
it up. These was generally Confederates. We was pestered
powerful by ’em. But Harrison’s scouts was as bad as any.
They pretended to be acting on the Union side. They was
made up of Southern men, mostly from Mississippi, Alabama,
and Tennessy. They was a torn-down bad set of men; bad
as the Rebs. They’d no respect for anybody or anything.
One Sunday a neighbor of mine met them coming up the
road. He knew them very well; and he said to them, it was
Sunday, and he hoped thar’d be no disturbances that day; the
people, he said, had all gone to preaching. That’s right, they
said; they believed in means of grace; and they asked whur
the preaching was to be, and who was going to preach. He
told them, and said he was going thar himself. They said
they believed a man did right to go to preaching, though they
was deprived of that privilege themselves. He told ’em he
hoped they’d look more after their eternal interest in futur’,
and they said they intended to, and inquired mo’e particular
whur the preaching was to be, and thanked him, and rode on.
They then just went to plund’ring, cl’aring out his house
about the fust one. Then they said they thought they’d take
his advice, and look a little after their eternal interests, and go
and hunt up the preaching. Then they just went over and
robbed the meeting. There was seventeen horses with sidesaddles
on ’em; the men generally went on foot, but the
weemun rode. They tuke every horse, and left the weemun
to walk home, and carry their saddles, or leave ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some Rebel bushwhackers,” said Mrs. ——, “went to the
house of a woman I know as well as I know my own sisters,
and because she wouldn’t give ’em her money—she had it in a
belt under her dress tied around her waist—they knocked her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>eye out; then they took their knives, and cut right through to
her flesh, cutting her money out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both Zeek and his father kept out of the war. The latter
was too old, and the former too young, to be swept in by the
conscription act. “Zeek escaped well!” said the mother,
with a gleam of exultation. “But I was just in dread he’d
be taken!” And I gathered that a little innocent maternal
fiction, as to his years, had been employed to shield him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some of the hardest times we saw, hyere in the Union
parts of Tennessy, was when they come hunting conscripts.
They got up some dogs now that would track a man. One
of my neighbors turned and shot a hound that was after him,
and got away. The men come up, and they was torn-down
mad when they saw the dog killed. They pressed a man and
his wagon to take the carcase back to town; they lived in
Adamsville, eight miles from hyere. They stopped to my
house over night, going back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They just bemoaned the loss of that dog,” said Mrs. ——.
“They said they’d sooner have lost one of their company.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They got back to town, and they buried that dog now
with great solemnity. They put a monument over his grave,
with an epitaph on it. But some of the conscripts they’d
been hunting, dug him up, and hung him to a tree, and shot
him full of bullets, and made a writing which they pinned to
the tree, with these words on it: ‘<em>We’ll serve the owners of the
dogs the same way next.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was Owl Crick swimming to-day, Zeek?” Mrs. ——
asked; meaning, was it so high that our beasts had to swim.
And that led to a remark as to the origin of the name.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thar’s right smart of owls on this Crick,” said Mr. ——;
“sometimes we’re pestered powerful by ’em; they steal our
chickens so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then we heard a wild squawking in the direction of the
hen-roost. “Thar’s one catching a chicken now,” quietly
observed the farmer. I certainly expected to see either him
or Zeek run out to the poor thing’s rescue. But they sat unconcernedly
in their chairs. It was the chicken’s business, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>theirs. The squawking grew fainter and fainter, and then
ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The people all through this section I allow will never
forget the battle,” said Mr. ——. “Friday night Johnson’s
left wing was at Brooks’s,—the last house you passed to-day
befo’e you fo’ded Owl Crick. The woods was just full of
men. They took Brooks, to make him show ’em the way.
He said he didn’t know the woods, and that was the fact;
but they swo’e he lied, and he must go with ’em, and they’d
shoot him if he led ’em amiss. He was in a powerful bad fix;
but, lucky for him they hadn’t gone fur when they met
Dammern, an old hunter, that knew every branch and thicket
in the country. So they swapped off Brooks for Dammern.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Federals was on the other side of us, and I allowed
there was going to be a battle. And it looked to me as if it
was going to be right on my farm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was the awfulest night I ever had in my life,” said
Mrs. ——. “My husband was for leaving at once. But it
didn’t appear like I could bear the idea of it. Though what
to do with ourselves if we staid? We’ve no cellar, and if
we’d had one, and got into it, a shell might have set the house
afire, and buried us under it. So I proposed we should dig a
hole to get into. He allowed that might be the best thing.
So the next morning I got off betimes, and went over and
counselled with our neighbors through the grove, and told ’em
I thought it would be a grand idee to dig a pit for both our
families, and so they came over hyere and went to digging.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You never see men work so earnest as we did till about
’leven o’clock,” said Mr. ——. “Finally we got the pit dug,
between the house and the spring. But when it was done it
looked so much like a grave the weemun dreaded to get into
it, and so much like a breastwork we men was afraid both
armies would just play their artilleries onto it. So my wife
give her consent we should take to the swamps. But what to
do with the pit? for if it got shelled, the house would be destroyed;
and then thar was danger the armies would use the
hole to bury their dead in, and the bodies would spoil our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>spring. And as we couldn’t take the pit with us, it appeared
like thar was but one thing to do. So we put in and worked
right earnest till we’d filled it up again. A rain had come on
Friday night, and bogged down some of Johnson’s artillery between
hyere and Corinth, and that’s my understanding why the
fight didn’t come off Saturday. That give us time to git off.
I took my family three miles back to a cabin in the swamp, and
thar they staid till it was all over; only Zeek and me come
back for some loads of goods. We took one load Saturday,
and come for another Monday. That was the second day of
the fight. We found the place covered with Rebel soldiers.
The battle was going on then. The roar of artillery was so
loud you couldn’t converse at one end of the house, whur the
echo was. The musketry sounded like a roaring wind; the
artillery was like peals of thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thar was one family caught on the battle-field. They
had staid, because the man was laying dangerously sick, and
they dreaded to move him. After the fighting begun, they
started to get away. The little boy was shot through the
head, and the horse killed. The weemun then just took up
the sick man and run with him down into the swamp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We had a nephew living on the battle-field,” said Mrs. ——.
“The family was down with the measles at the time. But
when they see thar was to be a fight, they just moved a plank
in the ceiling over head, and hid up all their bacon, and lard,
and corn-meal, and everything to eat they couldn’t take with
’em. Then they tuke up a child apiece and come on for us;
we’d done gone when they got hyere, and they come tearing
through the swampy ground after us, toting their babes. They
staid with us in the cabin till after the battle. But by that
time his house was occupied by soldiers. He’d been right
ingenious hiding his provisions, so nobody could find ’em;
but the soldiers went to tearing off ceilings to get planks to
make boxes, and down come the corn-meal and bacon; so they
had a pretty rich supply.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“After that,” said Mr. ——, “his house got burnt. Nearly
all the houses and fences for miles, on the battle-field, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>burnt, so that it was just one common. Thar was nobody
left. You never see such desolation. Then the armies moved
off, leaving a rich pasture. I had my cattle pastured thar all
that summer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. —— proposed that the children should sing for me a
little piece called “The Drummer Boy of Shiloh.” Her
husband favored the suggestion, saying it was “a right nice
composed little song.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve plumb forgotten it,” said Zeek. And the little girls,
who blushingly undertook it after much solicitation, could remember
only a few lines here and there, greatly to the parents’
chagrin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. —— was at times very thoughtful; and she told me a
newly married elder daughter had that day left home with her
husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll go by their house in the morning, and I’ll show it
to you,” said Zeek.</p>

<p class='c000'>I congratulated the parents on having their child settled so
near them; yet Mrs. —— could scarcely speak of the separation
without rising tears. All were eloquent in their praises
of the young husband. He was doing right well, when the
war, the cruel, wasteful war, swept him in, and he fought for
the slave despotism four years, without a dollar of pay. That
left him plumb flat. But he was a right smart worker. He
was a splendid hand to make rails. He could write also.
After the surrender, he just let in to work, and made a crop;
and after the crop was laid by, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, when the corn was hoed
for the last time,) he pitched into writing. He employed
himself as a teacher of that art. He had already taught nine
schools, of ten successive lessons each, at two dollars a scholar.
He had had as many as sixty pupils of an evening. I sympathized
sincerely with the satisfaction they all felt in having
their Maggie married to so smart a man. Indeed, I was beginning
greatly to like this little family, and to feel a personal
interest in all their affairs. It delights me now to recall that
December evening, spent in the red firelight of that humble
farm-house; and if I record their peculiarities of speech and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>manners, it is because they were characteristic and pleasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight o’clock, Zeek, weary with his long ride that day,
said, “I believe I’ll lie down,” and, without further ceremony,
took off his clothes and got into one of the beds in the room.
Mrs. —— thought I also must be tired, and said I could go to
bed when I pleased. Thinking it possible I might be assigned
to the same apartment, I concluded to sit up until the audience
became somewhat smaller. The girls presently went up-stairs,
lighted to their beds by the fire, which shone up the stairway
and through the cracks in the chamber floor. I took courage
then to say that I was ready to retire; and, to my gratification,
saw a candle lighted to show me to my chamber,—though
I marvelled where that could be, for I supposed I had
seen every room in the house, except the loft to which the
girls had gone, when I had seen the sitting-room and kitchen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. —— took me first out-doors, to a stoop on the side of
the house opposite the great opening. Thence a door opened
into a little framed box of a room built up against the log-house,
as an addition. There was scarcely space to turn in it.
The walls consisted of the naked, rough boards. There was
not even a latch to the door, which opened into the universal
night, and which the wind kept pushing in. Mr. —— advised
me to place the chair against it, which I did. I set the candle
in the chair, and blew it out after I had got into bed. Then
looking up, I saw with calm joy a star through the roof. It
was interesting to know that this was the bridal chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bed was deep and comfortable, and I did not suffer from
cold, although I could feel the fingers of the wind toying with
my hair. The night was full of noises, like the reports of
pistols. It was the old house cracking its joints.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIELD OF SHILOH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Daylight next morning shone in through the chinks of the
bridal chamber (for window it had none), and I awoke refreshed,
after sound sleep. The dawn was enlivened by pleasing
old-time sounds,—the farmer chopping wood at the door,
crowing cocks, gossiping geese, and the new-made fire snapping
and crackling in the next room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning was very cold. The earth was covered with
white frost, like snow. We had breakfast at the usual hour.
“Farmers commonly get their breakfases by sun-up,” said
mine host. At table (both doors open, and everybody shivering)
Mrs. —— remarked that if it was any colder in my
country she would not like to live there. I said to her,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“We should call this cold weather, though we have some
much colder. But, allow me to tell you, I have suffered more
from the cold since I have been in Tennessee, than I have for
ten years in the North. There, when we go out of doors in
winter, we go clad to meet the inclemencies of the season;
and we know how to make ourselves comfortable in our
houses. Here your houses are open. The wind comes in
through the cracks, and you do not even think of shutting the
doors. My people at home would think they would perish, if
they had to breakfast with the wind blowing on them, as you
have it blowing on you here.” In short, I said so much that
I got one of the doors closed, which I considered a great
triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek brought our animals to the gate; and I called for my
bill. Mr. —— said it appeared like he ought not to charge
me anything; he had been very glad of my company. As I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>insisted on discharging my indebtedness, he named a sum so
modest that I smiled. “You haven’t heard of the rage for
high prices, nor learned the art of fleecing the Yankees.” I
gave him twice the sum, but it was with difficulty I could
prevail upon him to accept it, for he said it would trouble his
conscience. A simple, thoroughly good and upright man,—would
there were more like him!</p>

<p class='c000'>I mounted my horse at the gate, and in company with Zeek
and his mule, set out for the battle-field. We struck Owl
Creek, but instead of crossing immediately, followed a cattle-path
along its bank. On our right were woods, their tops just
flushing with the new-risen sun; on our left, cornfields, in
some of which the corn had not yet been gathered, while in
others I noticed winter wheat, (ploughed in between the rows
of stalks, still standing,) covering the ground with its green
mat, now hoary with frost. Fording the creek at a safe place,
and pushing in an easterly direction through the woods, we
came to an army road, made by Wallace’s division moving on
towards Corinth, after the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a pleasant, still morning, such as always brings to the
susceptible spirit a sense of exhilaration. Leisurely we rode
among the wooded hills, which I could scarcely believe were
ever shaken by the roar of battle. Only the blue jay and the
woodpecker made the brown vistas of the trees echo with
their drumming and screaming, where had been heard the
shriek and whiz of missiles and bullets tapping the trunks.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little back from the cleared fields we came to a nice-looking
new log-hut. It had no window, and but one door. This
was closed; by which token Zeek knew the folks were away.
This was the abode of his sister and her interesting husband;
this the bridal home. Something tender and grateful swelled
up in my heart as I looked at the little windowless log-cabin,
and thought of the divine gift of love, and of happiness, which
dwells in humble places as well as in the highest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quitting Wallace’s road at its junction with a neighborhood
road, we struck another cow-path, which led in a northeasterly
direction through the woods. We soon came upon evidences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>of a vast encampment. Here our right wing had intrenched
itself after the battle. In this place I may remark that the
astonishing fact about this field is, that our army did not intrench
itself <em>before</em> the battle. Three weeks it lay at Shiloh,
menaced by the enemy; Grant himself pronounced an attack
probable, and the sagacious Sherman expected it; yet when it
came, it proved a perfect surprise; it found our lines badly
arranged, weak, and undefended by a single breastwork.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond was a magnificent field, swept of its fences, but
stuck all over with abandoned tent-supports, showing where
our finally victorious legions had lain. “This field was just
like a city after the fight,” said Zeek. I noticed that the
trees in the surrounding groves were killed. “The Yankees
skinned ’em for bark to lay on,” Zeek explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crossing Shiloh Branch,—a sluggish little stream, with
low, flat shores, covered with yellow sedge and sentinelled by
solemn dead trees,—we ascended a woody hill, along the crest
of which a row of graves showed where Hildebrand’s picket
line was attacked, on that disastrous Sunday morning. Each
soldier had been buried where he fell. The boughs, so fresh
and green that April morning, waving over their heads in the
sweet light of dawn, though dismantled now by the blasts of
winter, had still a tranquil beauty of their own, gilded and
sparkling with sunshine and frost. Fires in the woods had
burned the bottoms of the head-boards. I stopped at one grave
within a rude log-rail enclosure. “In memory of L. G. Miller,”
said the tablet; but the remainder of the inscription had been
obliterated by fire. I counted eighteen graves in this little row.</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode on to Shiloh Church,—formerly a mere log-cabin
in the woods, and by no means the neat white-steepled structure
on some village green, which the name of country church suggests
to the imagination. There Beauregard had his head-quarters
after Sunday’s battle. It was afterwards torn down
for its timbers, and now nothing remained of it but half-burnt
logs and rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below the hill, a few rods south of the church, Zeek
showed me some Rebel graves. There many a poor fellow’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>bones lay scattered about, rooted up by swine. I saw an old
half-rotted shoe, containing a skeleton foot. But the most
hideous sight of all, was a grinning skull pushed out of a hole
in the ground, exposing the neck-bone, with a silk cravat still
tied about it in a fashionable knot.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short distance southeast of the church we visited the
ruins of the Widow Ray house, burned to the ground in the
midst of its blasted orchard and desolated fields. “A girl
that lived hyere fell mightily in love with a Yankee soldier.
Saturday night, he allowed there was going to be a battle, and
come to bid her good-bye. He got killed; and she went
plumb distracted. She’s married now to a mighty clever
feller.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Zeek had another romantic story to tell, as we returned to
the church. “Hyere’s whur the bale of hay was. When
the Rebs was brushing out the Yankees, an old Reb found a
Yankee soldier nigh about this spot, that had been wounded,
and was perishing for a drink of water. He just took him,
and got him behind a bale of hay that was hyere, and give
him drink out of his canteen, just like he’d been his own
brother. Some of the time he’d be nussing him behind the
hay, and the rest he’d be shooting the Yankees over it.” Some
one asked him why he took such a heap of pains to save one
Yankee life, while he was killing as many mo’e as he could.
“They’re fighting enemies,” he said; “but a wounded man
is no longer an enemy, he’s a feller being.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Members of one family after all, though at war. Some
were so in a literal sense. I recall the story of two Kentucky
regiments that fought on this field, one for the bad cause and
one for the good. Two brothers met, and the Federal captured
the Rebel. The former recommenced firing, when the
latter said, “Don’t shoot there; that’s daddy behind that
tree.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cantering over the hills towards the northeast, we came to
the scene of a severe infantry fight in the woods. There was
a wild burial-place, containing some fifty patriot graves, originally
surrounded by a fence of stakes wattled with saplings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Both the fence and the head-boards had been broken down and
partly burned. All around us were sheep feeding in the open
woods; and withdrawn to the seclusion of the little burial-ground
was a solitary ewe and a pair of new-born lambs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All these hills are just lined with graves,” said Zeek.
Not far away was a fence surrounding the resting-places of
“two officers and seventeen private Rebels,” as an inscription
cut in the side of a black-jack informed us. There was a story
connected with these graves. A Federal soldier found on the
dead body of one of the officers, a watch, his likeness, his
wife’s likeness, a letter from his wife, and a letter written by
himself requesting that, in case he should fall, these relics
might be sent to her. The soldier faithfully fulfilled this duty;
and at the close of the war the wife, following the directions
he forwarded to her with them, came and found his grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode a mile due north through what Zeek termed “the
long avenue,” a broad, level opening through the woods, at
the farther end of which, “on the elevatedest part,” a Yankee
battery had been posted, doing terrible execution, if one might
judge by the trunks and boughs of trees lopped off by shot
and shell. The Rebels charged this battery repeatedly, and
it was captured and recaptured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the sedgy hills, and pursuing our course towards
the Landing, we were stopped by a trench in the woods. It
was one hundred and fifty feet long, and four deep. For some
reason both ends had been left open. Two feet from the bottom,
planks were laid across, the trench being filled with earth
over them. Beneath the planks the dead were buried. Their
bones could be seen at one of the open ends of the trench.
A row of head-boards indicated the graves of Illinois volunteers.</p>

<p class='c000'>We rode on to the spot which has given the battle its northern
name. Under high bluffs, on what Zeek called a “bench,”—a
shelf of land on the river bank,—approached from the
land side by a road running down through a narrow ravine,
stood the two log-huts, a dwelling and a grocery, which constituted
the town of “Pittsburgh.” There was not so much as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>a wharf there, but steamers made their landing against the
natural bank. There was absolutely nothing there now, the
two huts having been burned. Wild ducks sat afloat on the
broad, smooth breast of the river. It was not easy looking
down from those heights upon the tranquil picture, to call up
that other scene of battle-panic and dismay,—the routed Federal
troops pouring through the woods, disorganized, beaten,
seeking the shelter of the bluffs and the protection of the gun-boats;
the great conflict roaring behind them; the victorious
Rebels in wild pursuit; God’s solemn Sabbath changed to a
horrible carnival of mad passions and bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Rebels just fanned ’em out,” said Zeek. “The
Yankees put up white flags under the bluff, but the Rebels
didn’t come near enough to see ’em; they tuke a skeer,—the
Federals fell back so easy, they was afraid of some trick.
Thar was such a vast amount of ’em they couldn’t all get to
the Landing. Some got drowned trying to swim Snake Creek.
Numbers and numbers tried to swim the river. A Federal
officer told me he saw his men swim out a little ways, get cold,
then wind up together, and go to hugging each other, and
sink.” Such are the traditions of the fight which have passed
into the memory of the country people; but they should be
taken with considerable allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the level river bottom opposite the Landing we found an
extensive cornfield, bounded by heavy timber beyond. Under
that shore the gun-boats lay where they shelled the advancing
Rebels. It was there, emerging from the timber into
the open field, that our defeated army saw, that Sunday evening,
first the advanced cavalry, then a whole division of Buell’s
army coming to the rescue,—banners flying and bayonets
glittering among the trees. Glad sight! No wonder the runaways
under the bluffs made the welkin ring with their cheers!
If Buell did not arrive in time to save that day, he was in time
to save the next, and turn defeat into victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking the Hamburg Road up the river, we reached the
scene of General Prentiss’s disaster. The Rebels were in our
camps that Sunday morning almost before the alarm of attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>was given. First came the wild cries of the pickets rushing
in, accompanied by the scattering shots of the enemy, and followed
instantly by shells hurtling through the tents, in which
the inmates were just rousing from sleep; then, sweeping like
an avalanche through the woods, the terrible resistless battlefront
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Into the just-aroused camps thronged the Rebel regiments,
firing sharp volleys as they came, and springing towards our
laggards with the bayonet. Some were shot down as they
were running, without weapons, hatless, coatless, toward the
river. Others fell as they were disentangling themselves from
the flaps that formed the doors to their tents; others as they
were buckling on their accoutrements; a few, it was even said,
as they were vainly trying to impress on the cruelly-exultant
enemy their readiness to surrender. Officers were wounded
in their beds, and left for dead, who, through the whole two
days’ struggle, lay there gasping in their agony, and on Monday
evening were found in their gore, inside their tents, and
still able to tell the tale.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The houses all along the road were burned. In Prentiss’s
front was a farm, all laid waste, the orchard shot to pieces and
destroyed by balls. The woods all around were killed, perforated
with countless holes, as by the bills of woodpeckers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Striking the Hamburg and Purdy road, we went west to
the spot where the Rebel General Sydney A. Johnston fell,
pierced by a mortal wound. Zeek then piloted me through
the woods to the Corinth Road, where, time pressing, I took
leave of him, sorry I could not accept his invitation to go
home with him to dinner. It was five miles to his father’s
house; it was twenty miles to Corinth; and the day was already
half spent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Stopping occasionally to talk with the people along the
road, and dining at a farm-house, I did not reach Corinth until
sunset. The first thing I noticed, in passing the fortifications,
was that the huts of the negro garrison were dismantled; and
I found the citizens rejoicing over the removal of the troops.
I returned to Mr. M——’s house, and was welcomed by Mrs.
M——, who seemed almost to have forgotten that I was not
only a Yankee, but a “bad Yankee” from Massachusetts.
And here I may remark that, whatever hostility was shown
me by the Southern people on account of my Northern origin,
it usually wore off on a short acquaintance. Mrs. M—— had
a private room for me this time; and she caused a great, glowing
fire to be made in it for my comfort. After supper she
invited me into her sitting-room, where we talked freely about
the bad Yankees, the war, and emancipation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both her husband and father claimed to be Union men: but
their Unionism was of a kind too common in the South. They
hated the secession leaders almost as bitterly as they hated the
Yankee government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. M——: “Slavery was bad economy, I know; but oh,
it was glorious!”—spoken with a kind of romantic enthusiasm.
“I’d give a mint of money right now for servants like
I once had,—to have one all my own!”—clasping her hands
in the ardor of that passionate wish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ladies at the North,” she went on, “if they lose their servants,
can do their own work; but we can’t, we can’t!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She bemoaned the loss of a girl she formerly owned; a
bright mulattress, very pretty and intelligent. “She could
read and write as well as I could. There was no kind of work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>that girl couldn’t do. And so faithful!—I trusted everything
to her, and was never deceived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked if she could feel in her heart that it was right to
own such a creature.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believed in it as much as I believed in the Bible. We
were taught it from our infancy,—we were taught it with our
religion. I still think it was right; but I think it was because
we abused slavery that it was taken from us. Emancipation
is a worse thing for our servants than for us. They can’t take
care of themselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What has become of that favorite girl of yours?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is in St. Louis. She works at her trade there; she’s
a splendid dressmaker. Oh, if I only had her to make my
dresses now, like she used to! She owns the house and lot
where she lives; she has bought it with the money she has
earned. She’s married to a very fine mulatto man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems she can take care of herself a good deal better
than you can,” I remarked. “It is she who is independent;
it is you whom slavery has left helpless.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, some of them have made money, and know how to
keep it. But they are very few.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet do not those few indicate what the race may become?
And, when we consider the bondage from which they have
just broken, and the childish improvidence which was natural
to them in that condition, is it not a matter of surprise that so
many know how to take care of themselves?” She candidly
confessed that it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>As an illustration of a practice Southern ladies too commonly
indulge in, I may state that, while we were conversing,
she sat in the chimney-corner, chewing a dainty little quid,
and spitting into the fire something that looked marvellously
like tobacco juice.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was to take the train for Memphis at two o’clock in the
morning, I engaged a hackman to come to the house for me at
one. Relying upon his fidelity, I went to bed, slept soundly,
and awoke providentially at a quarter past the hour agreed
upon. I waited half an hour for him, and he did not appear.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Opening the door to listen for coming wheels, I heard the train
whistle. Catching up my luggage, which luckily was not
heavy, I rushed out to search, at dead of night, in a strange
town, lampless, soundless, and fast asleep, for a railroad depot,
which I should scarce have thought of finding even by daylight
without inquiring my way. Not a living creature was
abroad; not a light was visible in any house; I could not see
the ground I was treading upon. Fortunately I knew the
general direction in which the railroad lay; I struck it at last;
then I saw a light, which guided me to the depot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But where was the train? It was already over-due. I
could hear it whistling occasionally down the track, where
some accident had happened to it. The depot consisted of a
little framed box just large enough for a ticket-office. You
stood outside and bought your ticket through a hole. This
box contained a stove, a railroad lantern, and two men. The
door, contrary to the custom of the country, was kept scrupulously
shut. In vain were all appeals to the two men
within to open it. They were talking and laughing by their
comfortable fire, while the waiting passengers outside were
freezing. Two hours we waited, that cold winter’s night, for
the train which did not come. There was an express-office
lighted up near by, but there was no admittance for strangers
there either.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing a red flame a short distance up the railroad track,
and human forms passing at times before it, I went stumbling
out through the darkness towards it. I found it an encampment
of negroes. Twelve men, women, and children were
grouped in gypsy fashion about a smoky fire. They were in
a miserable condition, wretchedly clad, hungry, weary, and
sleepy, but unable to sleep. One woman held in her arms a
sick babe, that kept up its perpetual sad wail through the night.
The wind seemed to be in every direction, blowing the smoke
into everybody’s eyes. Yet these suffering and oppressed creatures
did for me what men of my own color had refused to do,—they
made room for me at their fire, and hospitably invited
me to share such poor comforts as they had. The incident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>was humiliating and touching. One man gave me an apple,
for which I was but too glad to return him many times its cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>They told me their story. They had been working all summer
for a planter in Tishemingo County, who had refused to
pay them, and they were now hunting for new homes. Two
or three had a little money; the rest had none. It made my
heart sick to look at them, and feel that it was out of my power
to do them any real, permanent service. But they were not
discouraged. Said the spokesman of the party, cheerfully,—an
old gray-haired man in tatters,—“I’ll drap my feet into
de road in de mornin’; I’ll go till I find somefin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing the train again, whistling in earnest this time, I
took leave of them, and reached the depot just as it arrived.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLVII.<br /> <span class='large'>FROM CORINTH TO MEMPHIS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At daylight we were running through the level lower counties
of West Tennessee. This is by far the most fertile division
of the State. Its soil is a rich black mould, adapted to the
culture of cotton, tobacco, and grains, which are produced in
great abundance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Occasionally in the dim dawn, and later in the forenoon, we
passed out-door fires about which homeless negroes had passed
the night, and around which they still sat or stood, in wretched
plight, but picturesque and cheerful,—old men and women,
young children, and tall girls in tattered frocks, warming their
hands, and watching with vacant curiosity the train as it shot
by.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s freedom! that’s what the Yankees have done for
’em!” was the frequent exclamation that fell from the lips of
Southern ladies and gentlemen looking out on these miserable
groups from the car windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ll all be dead before spring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Niggers can’t take care of themselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Southern people were always their best friends. How
I pity them! don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, of course I pity them! How much better off they
were when they were slaves!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With scarcely one exception there was to be detected in
these expressions a grim exultation. The slave-owners, having
foretold that freedom would prove fatal to the bondman,
experienced a satisfaction in seeing their predictions come true.
The usual words of sympathy his condition suggested had all
the hardness and hollowness of cant. Those who really felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>commiseration for his sufferings spoke of them in very different
tones of voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was another side to the picture. At every stopping-place,
throngs of well-dressed blacks crowded upon the
train. They were going to Memphis to “buy Christmas,”—as
the purchase of gifts for that gay season is termed. Happier
faces I have never seen. There was not a drunken or
disorderly person among them,—which would have been a
remarkable circumstance had the occasion been St. Patrick’s
day, or the Fourth of July, and had these been Irish or white
American laborers. They were all comfortably clad,—many
of them elegantly,—in clothes they had purchased with money
earned out of bondage. They paid with pride the full fares
exacted of free people, instead of the half fares formerly demanded
for slaves. They had still left in their purses ample
means to “buy Christmas” for their friends and relatives left
at home. They occupied cars by themselves which they filled
with the noise of cheerful conversation and laughter. And
nobody said of <em>them</em>, “That is freedom! That is what the
Yankees have done for them!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Past cotton-fields and handsome mansions in the pleasant
suburbs, we ran into Memphis,—a city which surprised me
by its beautiful situation and commercial activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Memphis stands on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi
River. It is the emporium of West Tennessee, Eastern Arkansas,
and Northern Mississippi, and is the most important
town between New Orleans and St. Louis. Its growth has
been rapid. Laid out in 1820, its population in 1840 was
8,839; in 1850, 16,000; in 1860, 50,000. Its present population
is not known; but it has immensely increased since the
last census, and is still increasing. I was told that, at the time
of my visit, the building of nineteen hundred new houses had
been contracted for, and that only labor was wanted to complete
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year ending September 1st, 1860, 400,000 bales of
cotton were shipped from this port. During seven months of
the year 1864,—May to November inclusive,—the shipments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>amounted to only 34,316 bales. In 1865, from May, the month
when the cotton released by the fall of the Confederacy began to
pour in, to December 22d, the date of my visit, the shipments
were 138,615 bales. These last figures, furnished me by the
government assessors, do not include the government cotton,
which passed untaxed, and a considerable quantity which
came to Memphis after being taxed in interior districts.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The view of the commerce of Memphis from the esplanade
overlooking the landing is one of the most animated imaginable.
You stand on the brow of the bluff, with the city behind
you, and the river below,—its broad, sweeping current severing
the States. From the foot of the bluff projects an extensive
shelving bank, with an understratum of sandstone; forming
a natural landing, commonly called a “levee,” although
no levee is here,—the celebrated levee at New Orleans having
impressed its name upon all landings of any importance up the
river. You look down upon a superb array of steamers, lying
along the shore; their elegantly ornamented pilot-houses and
lofty tiers of decks supported by slender pillars fully entitling
them to be named floating palaces. From the tower-like pipes
issue black clouds of smoke, with here and there rising white
puffs of steam. The levee is crowded with casks and cotton
bales, covering acres of ground. Up and down the steep way
cut through the brow of the bluff, affording access to the landing
from the town, a stream of drays is passing and repassing.
Freights are going aboard, or coming ashore. Drays are loading
and unloading. Bales of cotton and hay, casks, boxes,
sacks of grain, lumber, household furniture, supplies for plantations,
mules, ploughs, wagons, are tumbled, rolled, carried,
tossed, driven, pushed, and dragged, by an army of laborers,
from the levee along the broad wooden stages to the steamers’
decks. The movement, the seeming confusion, the rattling of
drays, the ringing of boats’ bells, the horrible snort of the
steam-whistle, the singing calls of the deck hands heaving at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>rope or lifting some heavy weight, the multitudinous shouts,
and wild, fantastic gesticulations of gangs of negroes driving
on board a drove of frightened mules, the voices of the teamsters,
the arriving and departing packets, drift-wood going down
stream, and skiffs paddling up,—the whole forms an astonishing
and amusing scene. Then over the immense brown
sand-bar of the Arkansas shore, and behind its interminable
line of dark forest boundaries, the sun goes down in a tranquil
sea of fire, reflected in the river,—a wonderfully contrasting
picture. Here all is life and animation; there all is softness
and peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evening comes, and adds picturesque effect to the scene.
The levee is lighted by great smoking and flaring flambeaux.
A grate swinging in a socket on the end of a pole is filled
with bituminous coal and wood, the blaze of which is enlivened
by flakes of oil-soaked cotton, resembling fat, laid on from a
bucket. The far-illuminating flame shoots up in the night,
while the ignited oil from the grate falls in little streams of
dripping blue fire into the river. Until late at night, and often
all night, amid darkness and fog and rain, the loading of freight
goes on by this lurid illumination. The laborers are chiefly
negroes whose ebon, dusky, sallow and tawny faces, lithe
attitudes, and sublime carelessness of attire, heighten the pictorial
effect of the scene. Bale after bale is tumbled from the
drays, and rolled down the levee,—a negro at each end of it
holding and guiding it with cotton-hooks. At the foot of the
landing it is seized by two other negroes, who roll it along
the plank to its place on the deck of the upward-bound boat.
Here are fifty men rolling barrels aboard, each at the other’s
heels; and yonder is a long straggling file of blacks crossing
the stage from the levee to the steamer, each carrying a box
on his shoulder.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>FREEDMEN’S SCHOOLS AND THE FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By a census taken in June, 1865, there were shown to be
16,509 freedmen in Memphis. Of this number 220 were
indigent persons, maintained, not by the city or the Bureau,
but by the freed people themselves. During the past three
years, colored benevolent societies in Memphis had contributed
five thousand dollars towards the support of their own
poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were three thousand pupils in the freedmen’s schools.
The teachers for these were furnished, here as elsewhere,
chiefly by benevolent societies in the North. Such of the
citizens as did not oppose the education of the blacks, were
generally silent about it. Nobody said of it, “That is freedom!
That is what the Yankees are doing for them!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Visiting these schools in nearly all the Southern States, I
did not hear of the white people taking any interest in them.
With the exception of here and there a man or woman inspired
by Northern principles, I never saw or heard of a
Southern citizen, male or female, entering one of those humble
school-rooms. How often, thinking of this indifference,
and watching the earnest, Christian labors of that little band
of refined and sensitive men and women and girls, who had
left cheerful homes in the North and voluntarily exposed
themselves to privation and opprobrium, devoting their noblest
energies to the work of educating and elevating the despised
race,—how often the stereotyped phrase occurred to me,
“The Southern people were always their best friends!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The wonder with me was, how these “best friends” could
be so utterly careless of the intellectual and moral interests of
the freedmen. For my own part, I could never enter one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>those schools without emotion. They were often held in old
buildings and sheds good for little else. There was not a
school-room in Tennessee furnished with appropriate seats and
desks. I found a similar condition of things in all the States.
The pews of colored churches, or plain benches in the vestries,
or old chairs with boards laid across them in some loft over a
shop, or out-of-doors on the grass in summer,—such was the
usual scene of the freedmen’s schools.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the branches taught, and in the average progress made,
these do not differ much from ordinary white schools at the
North. In those studies which appeal to the imagination and
memory, the colored pupil excels. In those which exercise
the reflective and reasoning faculties, he is less proficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is in the contrasts of age and of personal appearance
which they present, that the colored schools differ from all
others. I never visited one of any size in which there were
not two or three or half a dozen children so nearly white that
no one would have suspected the negro taint. From these, the
complexion ranges through all the indescribable mixed hues, to
the shining iron black of a few pure-blooded Africans, perhaps
not more in number than the seemingly pure-blooded whites.
The younger the generation, the lighter the average skin; by
which curious fact one perceives how fast the race was bleaching
under the “peculiar” system of slavery.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The contrast of features is no less than that of complexions.
Here you see the rosy child, whose countenance shows a perfect
Caucasian contour, shaded perhaps by light brown curls,
reciting in the same class with thick-lipped girls and woolly-headed
boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difference in ages is even more striking. Six years
and sixty may be seen, side by side, learning to read from the
same chart or book. Perhaps a bright little negro boy or girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>is teaching a white-haired old man, or bent old woman in
spectacles, their letters. There are few more affecting sights
than these aged people beginning the child’s task so late in
life, often after their eyesight has failed. Said a very old man
to a teacher who asked him his age, “I’m jammed on to a
hundred, and dis is my fust chance to git a start.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The scholars are generally well behaved. It is the restlessness
and love of fun of the younger ones which prove the
greatest trial to the teacher’s patience. The proportion of<a id='t338'></a>
vicious mischief-makers is no greater than in white schools.
In the evening-schools, attended chiefly by adults, all is interest
and attention. The older pupils are singularly zealous
and assiduous in their studies. The singing is usually excellent.
Never shall I forget the joyous blending of sweet, rich,
exultant childish voices, to which I often listened. The voices
of singing children are always delightful and touching: how
especially so the musical choruses of children, once slaves,
singing the glad songs of freedom!</p>

<p class='c000'>At Memphis, as at Nashville and other points in Tennessee,
I saw much of the operations of the Freedmen’s Bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Fiske appeared to me peculiarly fitted for his position;
and he was generally supported by firm and efficient
officers; although, like all the Assistant-Commissioners I
saw, he complained that the law establishing the Bureau did
not permit him to choose his own agents. He had to take
such army officers as were given him; some of whom were
always found to be incompetent, or neglectful of their duties,
or so prejudiced for or against the blacks that they were rendered
incapable of administering justice. A few were in sympathy
with slavery. Others, meaning to do right, were seduced
from a straightforward course by the dinners to which they
were invited by planters who had favors to ask. With such,
the rights of the freedmen were sure to suffer, when into the
opposite scale were thrown the aristocratic Rebel’s flattering
attentions and the smiles of his fair daughters.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_338.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>TEACHING THE FREEDMEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>It was the practice of the agents of the Bureau to make
frequent tours of their counties, and General Fiske himself was
in the habit of running off every few days to visit some important
point, where his organizing and conciliatory influence was
necessary. Often he would find the planters and the freedmen
separated by hedges of animosity and distrust. Usually his
first step was to call together as large an audience as could be
obtained of both classes, and explain to them the object of the
Bureau, and the duty each class owed the other. In nearly
every instance, earnestness and common sense prevailed; the
freedmen came forward and made contracts with the land-owners,
and the land-owners conceded to the freedmen advantages
they had refused before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes exciting and dramatic scenes occurred at these
meetings. “Not long ago,” said General Fiske, “I addressed
a mixed audience of three thousand persons at Spring Hill.
The meeting was presided over by a black man. Rebel generals
and Federal generals sat together on the platform. I
made a short speech, and afterwards answered questions for
anybody, white or black, that chose to ask them. I had said
that the intention of the Bureau was to do justice to all, without
respect to color; when there rose up in the audience a
tall, well dressed, fine-looking woman, sallow, very pale, and
much agitated, and wished to know if <em>she</em> could have justice.
Said she, ‘I was owned by a respectable planter in this neighborhood
who kept me as his wife for many years. I have
borne him five children. Two of them are dead. A short
time ago he married another woman, and drove me and my
three children off.’ The man was in the audience. Everybody
present knew him, and there were a hundred witnesses that
could vouch for the truth of the woman’s story. I told her
justice should certainly be done in her case. The respectable
planter now supports her and her three children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I have known many wrongs of this nature to be righted by
the Bureau; the late slave-owners learning that instead of
making their offspring by bondwomen profitable to them as
chattels, in the new order of things they were to be held responsible
for their maintenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen’s courts were designed to adjudicate upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>cases which could not be safely intrusted to the civil courts.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
They are in reality military courts, and the law by which they
are governed is martial law. I found them particularly efficient
in Tennessee. The annoying technicalities and legal quibbles
by which, in ordinary courts, the truth is so often inextricably
embarrassed, were here swept aside, and justice reached with
admirable directness. I have watched carefully scores of cases
decided by these tribunals, and do not remember one in which
substantial justice was not done. No doubt exceptions to this
rule occur, but I am satisfied that they are no more frequent
than those which occur in common-law courts; and they are
insignificant compared with the wholesale wrong to which the
unprotected freedman would be subjected in communities where
old slave codes and immemorial prejudice deny to him human
rights.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen’s court is no respecter of persons. The
proudest aristocrat and the humblest negro stand at its bar on
an equal footing. I remember a case in which a member of
the Tennessee Legislature was the defendant, and upwards of
twenty freedmen hired by him were the plaintiffs. He had
voted against the Negro Testimony Bill, which, if it had
passed, would have placed his case in a civil court; and now
he had the satisfaction of seeing eight of these blacks stand up
and testify against him. He admitted that they were faithful
and truthful men; and their testimony was so straightforward,
I was astonished that he should have waited to have his
accounts with them adjusted by the Bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many difficulties arise from honest misunderstandings between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the contracting parties. These are decided by the
Bureau according to general rules of equity, and nearly
always to the satisfaction of both. I was assured by several
of the most experienced officers of the Bureau in Tennessee,
that, in cases where contracts were fully understood, they were
much less frequently broken by the freedmen than by the
whites.</p>

<p class='c000'>Complaints of assaults upon freedmen, and even upon women
and girls, were very common. Here is a simple story of wrong
related to me by a girl of fourteen whom I saw, weary and
famished and drenched, after she had walked thirty-four miles
to obtain the protection of the Bureau, bearing the marks of
cruel beatings upon her back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My name is Milly Wilson; I live in Wilson County; my
mistress’s brother was my father. I have been kept a slave
since Emancipation. I worked in de cornfield; I had to hoe
and drap corn; I ho’ped gether the corn and shuck it. I had
to cuke; and I had spinning to do. I ho’ped sow, hoe, and
pick cotton. I had to pick bolls and bring ’em into house,
and pick cotton out o’ bolls till chickens crowed for midnight.
Dey never give me nothing. I didn’t dare ax ’em for wages;
and dey said if I run away dey’d shoot me. My mistress
tried to whoop me, but she couldn’t; I’d run from her.
Den her son Tom whooped me with a soap-paddle till he
broke it. He struck me side of head with his fist, and knocked
me down.” (Her face was still discolored by the blow.) “His
father said, ‘That’s no way to beat ’em; take ’em down and
paddle ’em.’ Dat night I lef’. I told Jennie to tell ’em I’d
gone to Murfreesboro’, so dey wouldn’t git on de right track;
and I started for Nashville. It wasn’t long till day when I
lef’. I walked till sun-up; and laid by de balance part of de
day in an old barn. I had nothing to eat, but on’y jist de
meat and bread I had for my supper I took and carried with
me for de nex’ day. De nex’ night de moon riz. I couldn’t
see de moon, but it give light enough so I could see how to
walk. Two miles from Triune I found some friends, and dey
give me breakfas’. Wednesday mornin’ it was sleetin’, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>dey give me a shawl. Thursday I got to Nashville. Now I
want to send for my clothes; for it was so dark when I lef’ I
couldn’t see to find ’em. I lef’ my clothes, and a skillet and
led, and a basket.” The court sent not only for these, but for
Master Tom who had paddled her, and for Master Tom’s
father who had abetted the outrage and held her enslaved
after slavery was abolished. This is a very mild case compared
with some that came to my knowledge, too horrible or
too disgusting to be narrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen’s affairs in West Tennessee were giving the
Bureau daily less and less trouble,—both whites and blacks
beginning to learn that contracts were made to be kept, and
that their mutual interests depended upon mutual good-will.
The most aggravated and embarrassing cases were from Mississippi.
The farce of opening the civil courts to the blacks
in that State had caused a discontinuance of the freedmen’s
courts, and the result was a stampede of wronged and outraged
people across the line. During an hour I spent at the Bureau
one morning, a stream of these cases kept coming in. The
newly organized Mississippi militia, under pretence of searching
for arms which the blacks were supposed to have provided
for the forthcoming Christmas insurrections, had committed
robberies, murders, and other outrages, against these unoffending
and unprotected people. The Bureau at Memphis could
do nothing but refer these cases to the Assistant-Commissioner
at Vicksburg, who could do nothing but refer them to the civil
courts, which let them alone. One case I recall, however, in
which the officers at Memphis thought they could do something.
A colored man, who had been managing a Mississippi
plantation under contract for a quarter of the crop, came to
Memphis for a redress of grievances. The owner had given
him fifteen dollars, and refused to give him anything more
for his labor. The cotton was baled, and ready for market.
It would soon be in Memphis. “Keep watch of that cotton,”
said the agent; “and as soon as it arrives, we will attach it,
and you shall have your share.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While I was there, two negroes came in from Parson Botts’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>plantation, in De Soto County, (Mississippi,) bringing guns
which they had run off with on the approach of the militia.
The wife of one of these men had been beaten over the head
with a pistol, and afterwards hung by the neck, to compel her
to disclose where the guns were hidden. In this case there
was no redress.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great variety of business is brought before the Bureau.
Here is a negro-man who has printed a reward offering fifty
dollars for information to assist him in finding his wife and
children, sold away from him in times of slavery: a small sum
for such an object, you may say, but it is all he has, and he
has come to the Bureau for assistance. Here is a free mulattress,
who was stolen by a guerilla during the war, and sold
into slavery in Arkansas, and she has come to enter a claim
for wages earned during two years of enforced servitude.
Yonder is a white woman, who has been warned by the police
that she must not live with her husband because he is black,
and who has come to claim protection in her marriage relation,
bringing proof that she is in reality a colored woman. That
poor old crippled negro was maimed for life when a slave by a
cruel master, who will now be compelled to pension him.
Yonder comes an old farmer with a stout colored boy, to get
the Bureau’s sanction to a contract they wish to make. “Pull
off your hat, Bob,” says the old man; “you was raised to
that;” for he was formerly the lad’s owner. He claims to
have been a Union man. “I was opposed to secession till I
was swep’ plumb away.” He is very grateful for what the
officers do for him, and especially for the good advice they
give the boy. “I’ll do well by him, and larn him to read,
if he’ll do well by me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As they go out, in comes a powerful, short-limbed black,
in tattered overcoat, with a red handkerchief on his head, and
with a lordly countenance, looking like a barbarian chief. He
has made a crop; found everything—mules, feed, implements;
hired his own help,—fifteen men and women; managed
everything; by agreement he was to have one half; but,
owing to an attempt to swindle him, he has had the cotton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>attached; and now it is not on his own account he has come,
but he is owing his men wages, and they want something for
Christmas, which he thinks reasonable, and he desires the
Bureau’s assistance to raise three hundred dollars on the said
cotton. “For I’m bound,” he says, “to be liberal with my
men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is a boy, who was formerly a slave, to whom his
father, a free man, willed a sum of money, which the boy’s
owner borrowed, giving his note for it, but never repaid,—for
did not the boy and all that he had belong to his master?
The worn and soiled bit of paper is produced; and now the
owner will have that money to restore, with interest. Lucky for
the boy that he kept that torn and dirty scrap carefully hidden
all these years! Such documents are now serving to right
many an ancient wrong. I saw at the Freedmen’s Bureau at
Richmond a large package of wills, made in favor of slaves,
usually by their white fathers, all which had been suppressed
by the legitimate heirs. One, a mere rotten and jaundiced
rag, scarcely legible, had been carried sewed in the lining of
a slave-woman’s dress for more than forty years,—the date
of the will being 1823. Her son was legally emancipated by
that instrument; but her owner, who claimed to be his owner
by inheritance, threatened to kill her if the will was not destroyed,
and he believed that it had been destroyed. That
boy was now a middle-aged man, having passed the flower of
his years in bondage; and his mother was an old woman,
living to thank God that her son was free at last. The master,
a rich man, had as yet no idea of the existence of that will, by
which he was to be held responsible for the payment of over
forty years’ wages to his unlawful bondman.</p>

<p class='c000'>From another of these documents, made by a white master,
I copied the following suggestive paragraph: “It is also my
last will and desire that <em>my beloved wife</em> <span class='sc'>Sally Dandridge</span>,
and <em>my son</em> <span class='sc'>Harrison</span>, and <em>my daughters</em> <span class='sc'>Charity</span> and <span class='sc'>Julia</span>,
should be free; and it is my wish and desire for them to be
emancipated hereafter, and for them to remain as free people.”
Another paragraph gave them property. This will, like nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>all the rest, had been registered and proved; and, like them, it
had been suppressed,—the beloved wife and son and daughters
remaining in bondage, until the slave system went down with
the Rebellion, and a day of judgment came with the Freedmen’s
Bureau.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br /> <span class='large'>DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At Memphis I took passage in a first-class Mississippi steam-packet
for Vicksburg. It was evening when I went on board.
The extensive saloon, with its long array of state-rooms on
each side, its ornamental gilt ceiling, and series of dazzling
chandeliers, was a brilliant spectacle. A corps of light-footed
and swift-handed colored waiters were setting the tables,—bringing
in baskets of table-cloths, and spreading them; immense
baskets of crockery, and distributing it; and trays of
silver, which added to the other noises its ringing and jingling
accompaniment. About the stove and bar and captain’s office,
at the end of the saloon, was an astonishing crowd of passengers,
mostly standing, talking, drinking, buying tickets, playing
cards, swearing, reading, laughing, chewing, spitting, and
filling the saloon, even to the ladies’ cabin at the opposite end,
with a thick blue cloud which issued from countless bad pipes
and cigars, enveloped the supper-tables, and bedimmed the
glitter of the chandeliers. In that cloud supper was to be
eaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a signal known only to the initiated I noticed that pipes
were put out and quids cast out, and a mighty rush began.
Two lines of battle were formed, confronting each other, with
the table between them, each dauntless hero standing with
foot advanced, and invincible right hand laid upon the back
of a chair. In this way every place was secured at least five
minutes before the thundering signal was given for the beginning
of the conflict. At last the gong-bearing steward, poising
his dread right hand, anxiously watched by the hostile
hosts, till the ladies were fairly seated, beat the terrible roll
and, instantly, every chair was jerked back with a simultaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>clash and clatter, every soldier plunged forward, every
coat-tail was spread, and every pair of trousers was in its
seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, rallied by the gong from deck and state-room and
stove, came the crowd of uninitiated ones, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quorum pars parva
fui</span></i>,) hungry, rueful-faced, dismayed, finding themselves in the
unhappy position of the fifth calf that suckled the cow with
but four teats,—compelled to wait until the rest had fed.</p>

<p class='c000'>After supper, there were music and dancing in the after-part
of the saloon, and gambling, and clicking glasses, and
everlasting talk about Yankees and niggers and cotton, in the
other part. There were a few Federal officers in their uniforms,
and a good many Rebel officers in civil dress. I recognized
a thin sprinkling of Northern capitalists and business
men. But the majority were Mississippi and Arkansas planters
going down the river to their estates: a strongly marked,
unrefined, rather picturesque class,—hard swearers, hard
drinkers, inveterate smokers and chewers, wearing sad-colored
linen for the most part, and clad in coarse “domestic,” slouching
in their dress and manners, loose of tongue, free-hearted,
good-humored, and sociable. They had been to Memphis to
purchase supplies for their plantations, or to lease their plantations,
or to hire freedmen, or to “buy Christmas” for their
freedmen at home. They appeared to have plenty of money,
if the frequency with which they patronized the bar was any
criterion. Liquors on board the Mississippi steamers were
twenty-five cents a glass, and the average cost of such dram-drinking
as I witnessed could not have been less than three or
four dollars a day for each man. A few did not seem to be
much attracted by the decanters; while others made drafts
upon them every hour, or two or three times an hour, from
morning till bedtime, and were never sober, and never quite
drunk.</p>

<p class='c000'>How shall I describe the conversation of these men? Never
a word did I hear fall from the lips of one of them concerning
literature or the higher interests of life; but their talk was of
mules, cotton, niggers, money, Yankees, politics, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Freedmen’s Bureau,—thickly studded with oaths, and garnished
with joke and story.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once only I heard the subject of education indirectly alluded
to. Said a young fellow, formerly the owner of fifty niggers,—“I’ve
gone to school-keeping.”—“O Lord!” said his
companion, “you ha’n’t come down to that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I judged that most were married men, from a remark made
by one of them: “A married man thinks less of personal appearance
than a bachelor. I’ve done played out on that since
I got spliced.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were a few Tennesseeans aboard, who envied the Mississippians
their Rebel State government, organized militia, and
power over the freedmen. “We might make a pile, if we
could only regulate the labor system. But that can’t be done
in this dog-goned Brownlow State. In Mississippi, if they
can only carry out the laws they’ve enacted, there’ll be a
chance.” It was impossible to convince these gentlemen that
the freedmen could be induced to work by any other means
than despotic compulsion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the gamblers over their cards, and the tipplers over
their glasses, I went to bed,—to be awakened at midnight by
an inebriated gentleman (weight two hundred, as he thickly
informed me) climbing into the berth above me.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a night of fog, Christmas morning dawned. In the
cabin, the generous steward gave to each passenger a glass of
egg-nog before breakfast; not because it was Christmas, but
because passengers were human, and egg-nog (especially the
whiskey in it) was one of the necessities of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning was warm and beautiful. Mists were chasing
each other on the river, and clouds were chasing each other in
the sky. A rival steamer was passing us. The decks of
both boats were black with spectators watching the race, and
making comments upon it: “Look how she piles the water
up ahead of her!” “She’ll open a gap of a mile between
us in an hour!” and so forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The river was about half a mile in breadth. We were running
down the broad current between high banks covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>with forests, on one side, and sand-bars extending their broad
yellow shelves out into the river, on the other. Sometimes
the sand was on our right, then it shifted to our left; it was
nearly always to be seen on one side, but never on both sides
at once. The river is continually excavating one bank and
making another opposite,—now taking from Arkansas to give
to Mississippi, and now robbing Mississippi to pay Arkansas,
and thus year after year forming and destroying plantations.
I remember one point on the Arkansas shore where the bank
rose forty feet above the water, and was covered with trees
eighteen inches in thickness; of which a gentleman of the
country said to me, “That is all a recent formation. Forty
years ago the bed of the river was where that bank is.” The
water was now tearing away again what it had so suddenly
built up, trying to get back into its old bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were making landings at every plantation where passengers
or freight were to be put off, or a signal was shown
from the shore. Sometimes a newspaper or piece of cloth was
fluttered by negroes among the trees on the bank; or a man
who wished to come on board, stood on some exposed point
and waved his handkerchief or hat. There was never a wharf,
but the steamer, rounding to in the current, and heading up
stream, went bunting its broad nose against the steep, yielding
bank. The planks were pushed out; the passengers stepped
aboard or ashore, and the deck-hands landed the freight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dirtier or more toilsome work than this landing of the
freight I have seldom seen. Heavy boxes, barrels of flour
and whiskey, had to be lifted and rolled up steep paths in the
soft sand to the summit of the bank. Often the paths were
so narrow that but one man could get hold of the end of a
barrel and lift it, while another hauled it from above, their
feet sinking deep at every step. Imagine a gang of forty or
fifty men engaged in landing boxes, casks, sacks of corn and
salt, wagons, live-stock, ploughs; hurrying, crowding, working
in each other’s way, sometimes slipping and falling, the lost
barrel tumbling down upon those below; and the mate driving
them with shouts and curses and kicks, as if they were so
many brutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Here the plantations touched the river; and there the landing-place
was indicated by blazed trees in the forest, where
negroes and mules were in waiting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wooding-up was always an interesting sight. A long wood-pile
lines the summit of the bank, perhaps forty feet above the
river. The steamer lands; a couple of stages are hauled out:
fifty men rush ashore and climb the bank; the clerk accompanies
them with pencil and paper and measuring-rod, to take
account of the number of cords; then suddenly down comes
the wood in an amazing shower, rattling, sliding, bounding,
and sometimes turning somersaults into the river. The bottom
and side of the bank are soon covered by the deluge; and the
work of loading begins in equally lively fashion. The two
stages are occupied by two files of men, one going ashore at a
dog-trot, empty-handed, and another coming aboard with the
wood. Each man catches up from two to four sticks, according
to their size or his own inclination, shoulders them,
falls into the current, not of water, but of men, crosses the
plank, and deposits his burden where the corded-wood, that
stood so lately on the top of the bank, is once more taking
shape, divided into two equally-balanced piles on each side of
the boiler-deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men are mostly negroes, and the treatment they receive
from the mate is about the same as that which they
received when slaves. He stands on the shore between the
ends of the two stages, within convenient reach of both. Not
a laggard escapes his eye or foot. Often he brandishes a billet
of wood, with which he threatens, and sometimes strikes;
and now he flings it at the head of some artful dodger who
has eluded his blow. And all the while you hear his hoarse,
harsh voice iterating with horrible crescendo: “Get along,
<em>get along</em>! Out o’ the way’th that wood! <em>out o’ the way</em>, <span class='fss'>OUT
O’ THE WAY</span>! OUT O’ THE WAY! <em>Git on</em>, <span class='fss'>GIT ON</span>, GIT
ON!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the men are working as hard as men can reasonably
be expected to work; and how they discipline their
souls to endure such brutality is to me a mystery.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Planters got off at every landing, by day and night; and
although a few came aboard, the company was gradually thinning
out. At one plantation a colony of sixty negroes landed.
They had a “heap of plunder.” Beds and bedding, trunks,
tubs, hen-coops, old chests, old chairs, spinning-wheels, pots,
and kettles, were put off under the mate’s directions, without
much ceremony. The dogs were caught and pitched into the
river, much to the distress of the women and children, who
appeared to care more for the animals than for any other portion
of their property. These people had been hired for an
adjoining plantation. The plantation at which we landed had
been laid waste, and the mansion and negro-quarters burned,
leaving a grove of fifty naked chimneys standing,—“monuments
of Yankee vandalism,” said my Southern friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one place a fashionably dressed couple came on board,
and the gentleman asked for a state-room. Terrible was the
captain’s wrath. “God damn your soul,” he said, “get off
this boat!” The gentleman and lady were colored, and they
had been guilty of unpardonable impudence in asking for a
state-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kick the nigger!” “He ought to have his neck broke!”
“He ought to be hung!” said the indignant passengers, by
whom the captain’s prompt and energetic action was strongly
commended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unwelcome couple went quietly ashore, and one of the
hands pitched their trunk after them. They were in a dilemma:
their clothes were too fine for a filthy deck passage, and
their skins were too dark for a cabin passage. So they sat
down on the shore to wait for the next steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They won’t find a boat that’ll take ’em,” said the grim
captain. “Anyhow, they can’t force their damned nigger
equality on to me!” He was very indignant to think that he
had landed at their signal. “The expense of running this
boat is forty dollars an hour,—six thousand dollars a trip;—and
I can’t afford to be fooled by a nigger!” I omit the
epithets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards I heard the virtuous passengers in calmer moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>talking over the affair. “How would you feel,” said
one, with solemn emphasis, “to know that <em>your wife was sleeping
in the next room to a nigger and his wife</em>?” The argument
was unanswerable: it was an awful thought!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is not a place of any importance on the river between
Memphis and Vicksburg, a distance of four hundred miles.
The nearest approach to an exception is Helena, on the Arkansas
shore, a hastily built, high-perched town, looking as if
it had flown from somewhere else and just lit. Another place
of some note is Napoleon, which was burnt during the war.
Here there is one of those natural “cut-offs” for which the
Mississippi is remarkable; the river having formed for itself a
new channel, half a mile in length, across a tongue of land
about which it formerly made a circuit of twelve miles. We
passed through the cut-off, and afterwards made a voyage of
six miles up the old channel, which resembles a long, placid,
winding lake, to Beulah Landing, called after a novel of that
name written by a Southern lady.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember Beulah as the scene of a colored soldier’s return.
He had no sooner landed from the steamer than his
friends in waiting seized him, men, women, and girls, some
grasping his hands, some clinging to his arms and waist, others
hanging upon his neck, smothering him in their joyful embraces.
All who could reach him hugged him; while those
who could not reach him hugged those who were hugging
him, as the next best thing to be done on the happy occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below Napoleon, the cleared lands of many plantations extend
to the river, while others show only a border of trees
along the shore. The banks were continually caving, masses
of earth flaking off and falling into the turbid current, as we
passed. The levees, neglected during the war, were often in
a very bad condition. The river, encroaching upon the shores
upon which these artificial embankments were raised, had
made frequent breaches in them, and in many places swept
them quite away; so that whole plantations lay at the mercy
of the usual spring freshets, which render cotton culture on
such unprotected lands impracticable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>The power and extent of these freshets is something astonishing.
The river averages nearly half a mile in width. Its
depth is very great, often exceeding one hundred feet. Its
average velocity is something over two miles an hour. Yet
when come the sudden rains and thaws, and the great tributaries,
with their thousand lesser streams, pour their floods
into the bosom of the Father of Waters, this huge artery becomes
but an insignificant channel for them, and they spread
out into a vast lake inundating the valley. The course of the
river is then traceable only by the swifter current in its vicinity,
and by the broad sinuous opening through the forests.
A gentleman of my acquaintance told me that in Bolivar
County, Mississippi, he had ridden thirty miles back from the
river, and seen all the way the marks of high water on the
trees as far up as he could reach with his riding-whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crevasses, or breaks in the levees and banks, which
occur at such times, are often terrific. Plantations are destroyed,
and buildings swept away. Boats are drawn into the
current and carried inland, to be landed, like the Ark, on the
subsidence of the waters, or lost among the trees of the deep
swamps.</p>

<p class='c000'>The violence of these freshets is said to be on the increase
of late years, from two or three causes,—the drainage of
newly cultivated lands; and the cut-offs and the levees, which
project the floods more directly upon the lower country, instead
of retarding the water, and suffering it to spread out
gradually over the valley, naturally subject to its overflow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best-protected plantations are those which are completely
surrounded by independent levees. “If my neighbor’s
levee breaks, my land is still defended,” said a planter to me,
describing his estate. “Inside of the levee is a ditch by which
the water that soaks in can all be drained to one place and
thrown over the embankment by a steam-pump.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I learned something of the planter’s anxiety of mind during
the great floods. “Many is the time I’ve sat up all night
just like these mates, looking after the levee on my plantation.
Come a wind from the right direction, I’d catch up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>lantern, and go out, and maybe find the water within three or
four inches of the top. In some places a little more would
send it over and make a break. My heart would be nigh
about to melt, as I watched it. Sometimes I waited, all night
long, to see whether the water would go an inch higher. If it
didn’t, I was safe; if it did, I was a ruined man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On some of the levees negroes were at work making the
necessary repairs; but I was told that many plantations would
remain unprotected and uncultivated until another year.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had heard much about the anticipated negro insurrections
at Christmas time. But the only act of violence that came to
my knowledge, committed on that day, was a little affair that
occurred at Skipwith’s Landing, on the Mississippi shore, a few
miles below the Arkansas and Louisiana line. Four mounted
guerillas, wearing the Confederate uniform, and carrying
Spencer rifles, rode into the place, robbed a store kept by a
Northern man, robbed and murdered a negro, and rode off
again, unmolested. Very little was said of this trifling operation.
If such a deed, however, had been perpetrated by
freedmen, the whole South would have rung with it, and the
cry of “Kill the niggers!” would have been heard from the
Rio Grande to the Atlantic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER L.<br /> <span class='large'>IN AND ABOUT VICKSBURG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the afternoon of the third day we came in sight of
Vicksburg,—four hundred miles from Memphis by water,
although not more than half that distance in a straight line, so
voluminous are the coils of the Great River.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town, seen across the intervening tongue of land as we
approached it,—situated on a high bluff, with the sunlight on
its hills and roofs and fortifications,—was a fine sight. It
diverted my attention, so that I looked in vain for the famous
canal cut across the tongue of land, which pushes out from
the Louisiana shore, and about which the river makes an extensive
curve.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You couldn’t have found it without looking mighty
close,” said a native of the country. “It’s a little small
concern. The Yankees made just a big ditch to let the
water through, thinking it would wash out, and make a cut-off.
If it had, Farragut’s fleet could have got through, and
Vicksburg would have been flanked, high and dry. But, in
the first place, they did not begin the ditch where the current
strikes the shore; in the next place the water fell before the
ditch was completed, and never run through it at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the opposite shore, overlooking this peninsula and the
winding river, stands Vicksburg, on the brow of a line of
bluffs which sweep down from the north, here first striking
the Mississippi. In this ridge the town is set,—to compare
gross things with fine,—like a diamond in the back of a ring.
It slopes up rapidly from the landing, and is built of brick and
wood, not beautiful on a nearer view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hills are cut through, and their sides sliced off, by the
deeply indented streets of the upper portion of the city. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>and there are crests completely cut around, isolated, and left
standing like yellowish square sugar-loaves with irregular tops.
These excavations afforded the inhabitants fine facilities for
burrowing during the siege. The base of the hills and the
cliff-like banks of the dug streets present a most curious appearance,
being completely honey-combed with caves, which
still remain, a source of astonishment to the stranger, who
half fancies that a colony of large-sized bank-swallows has
been industriously at work there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The majority of the caves were mere “gopher-holes,” as
the soldiers call them. Others were quite spacious and aristocratic.
The entrance was usually large enough to admit a
person stooping slightly; but within, the roofs of the best
caves were hollowed sufficiently to permit a man to stand upright.
The passage by which you entered commonly branched
to the right and left, forming with its two arms a sort of letter
Y, or letter T.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every family had its cave. But only a few of the more
extensive ones were permanently occupied. “Ours” (said a
lady resident) “was very large and quite comfortable. There
was first the entrance, under a pointed arch; then a long cross-gallery.
Boards were laid down the whole length and covered
with carpets. Berths were put up at the sides, where we slept
very well. At first we did not take off our dresses when we
lay down; but in a little while we grew accustomed to undressing
and retiring regularly. In the morning we found
our clothes quite wet from the natural dampness of the cave.
Over the entrance there was built a little arbor, where our
cooking was done, and where we sat and talked with our
neighbors in the daytime, when there were no shells dropping.
In the night the cave was lighted up. We lived this sort of
life six weeks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But few buildings were destroyed by the shells. Those
that were partially injured had generally been patched up.
After the twenty-sixth of May, when the bombardment became
almost incessant, being continued night and day, it was
estimated that six thousand shells were thrown into the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>by the mortars on the river-side every twenty-four hours.
Grant’s siege guns, in the rear of the bluffs, dropped daily
four thousand more along the Rebel lines. The little damage
done by so great a bombardment is a matter of surprise. The
soldiers had also their “gopher-holes,” and laughed at the
projectiles. Of the women and children in the town, only
three were killed and twelve injured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both citizens and troops suffered more from the scarcity of
provisions than from the abundance of shells. On both the
river and land sides the city was completely cut off from supplies.
The garrison was put upon fourteen-and-a-half-ounce
rations; and in the town, mule-meat, and even dog-meat,
became luxuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after my arrival I joined a small equestrian party,
got up by Lieutenant E—— for my benefit, and rode out to
visit the fortifications behind the city. We first came to the
line of works thrown up by our troops after the capitulation.
Exterior to these, zigzagging along the eastern brow of the
bluffs, from the Mississippi, below Vicksburg, to the Yazoo
River on the North, a distance of near fifteen miles, were the
original Rebel defences, too extensive to be manned by less
than a large army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three miles northeast of the city we passed Fort Hill, in the
“crater” of which, after the Rebel bastions had been successfully
mined and blown up, occurred one of the most desperate
fights that marked the siege. Pushed up dangerously near
to the Rebel position, is the advanced Federal line. Between
the two, a little way down the slope from Fort Hill, is the spot
rendered historic by the interview which terminated the long
struggle for the key to the Mississippi. There, in full view
of the confronting armies, the two commanding generals met
under an oak-tree, and had their little talk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every vestige of the tree, root and branch, had long since
disappeared,—cut up, broken up, dug up, and scattered over
the country in the form of relics; and we found on the spot
a monument, which bids fair to have a similar fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was originally a neat granite shaft, erected by a private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>subscription among officers and soldiers of the national army,
and dedicated on July 4th, 1864, the first anniversary of the
surrender of the city. It bears the following inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>SITE OF</div>
    <div>INTERVIEW BETWEEN</div>
    <div>MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT, U. S. A.,</div>
    <div>AND</div>
    <div>LIEUTENANT-GENERAL PEMBERTON,</div>
    <div>JULY 4,</div>
    <div>1863.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nothing certainly could be more simple and modest. Not a
syllable is there to wound the sensibilities of a fallen foe. Yet,
since the close of the war, when the returning Confederates
first obtained access to this monument, it had been shamefully
mutilated. The fact that it was never injured before, and
the circumstance that the eagle and shield of the escutcheon
surmounting the inscription had been nearly obliterated by
persistent battering and grinding, showed that no mere relic-hunters
had been hammering here, but that the mischief had
been done by some enemy’s hand. The shaft was enclosed
by a handsome iron fence, which we found broken and partly
thrown down.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the monument we rode northward over ridges crowned
with zigzag fortifications, around steep crests and slopes, and
past deep ravines green with tangled cane-brakes,—a broken
and wild region; crossing over through woods and hilly cotton-fields
to the western brow of the bluffs, where Sherman made
his unsuccessful assault in the gloomy last days of 1862.</p>

<p class='c000'>We reined up our horses on a commanding point, and looked
down upon the scene of the battle. Away on our left was the
Mississippi, its bold curve sweeping in from the west, and doubling
southward toward the city. Before us, under the bluff,
was the bottom across which our forces charged, through the
bristling abatis and their terrible entanglements, and in the
face of a murderous fire captured the Rebel rifle-pits,—a most
heroic, bloody, but worse than useless work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Finding a road that wound down the steep hill-sides, we
galloped through the cotton-fields of the bottom to Chickasaw
Bayou, which bounded them on the west,—a small stream flowing
down through swamps and lagoons, from the Yazoo, and
emptying into the Mississippi below the battle-field. We rode
along its bank, and found one of the bridges by which our
forces had crossed. Beyond were ancient woods, sombre and
brown, bearded with long pendant moss.</p>

<p class='c000'>Returning across the bottom, the Lieutenant guided us to
three prominent elevations in the midst of the plain, which
proved to be Indian mounds of an interesting character. The
largest was thirty feet in height, and one hundred and fifty
feet across the base. Leaving the ladies in the saddle, the
Lieutenant and myself hitched our horses to a bush on one of
the smaller mounds, and entered an excavation which he had
assisted in making on a former visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the earth full of human bones and antique pottery.
A little digging exposed entire skeletons sitting upright,
in the posture in which they had been buried,—who knows
how many centuries before? Who were these ancient people,
over whose unknown history the past had closed, as the earth
had closed over their bodies? Perhaps these burial-mounds
marked the scene of some great battle on the very spot where
the modern fight took place.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the surface of the mound, washed by the storms
of centuries, speckled with bits of bones, yellowish, decayed,
and often friable to the touch. Fragments of pottery were
also exposed, ornamented in a variety of styles, showing that
this ancient people was not without rude arts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cotton-fields on the bluffs and in the bottom were cultivated
by a colony of freedmen, whose village of brown huts
we passed, on the broad hill-side above the river, as we returned
to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ride back over the western brow of the bluffs was one
to be remembered. The sun was setting over the forests and
plains of Louisiana, which lay dark on the horizon, between the
splendid sky and the splendid, wide-spreading river reflecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>it. Every cloud, every fugitive fleece, was saturated with fire.
The river was a flood of molten gold. The ever-varying glory
seemed prolonged for our sakes. The last exquisite tints had
scarcely faded, leaving the river dark and melancholy, sweeping
between its solitary shores, when we left the crests, with
the half-moon sailing in a thinly-clouded sky above our heads,
and descended, by the deep-cut, narrow streets, and through
the open gates at the breastworks, into the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, in company with Major-General Wood, in
command of the Department of Mississippi, I visited the fortifications
below Vicksburg. For a mile and a half we rode
along beside banks perforated with “gopher-holes” dug by
the Rebel soldiers, and lines of rifle-pits, which consisted often
of a mere trench cut across the edge of a crest. These were
the river-side defences. The real fortifications commenced
with a strong fort constructed on a commanding bluff. This
did not abut on the river, as maps I had seen, and descriptions
I had read, had led me to expect. Below the city a tract of
low bottom-land opens between the river and the bluffs, of
such a nature that no very formidable attack was to be apprehended
in that quarter. Standing upon the first redan, we
saw a mile or two of low land and tangled and shaggy cypress
swamps intervening between us and the glimpses of shining
light which indicated the southward course of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this excursion, as in that of the previous day, I noticed
on every side practical answers to the question, “Will the
freedmen work?” In every broken field, in every available
spot on the rugged crests, was the negro’s little cotton patch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding through the freedmen’s quarter below the town the
General and I called at a dozen or more different cabins, putting
to every person we talked with the inquiry,—how large
a proportion of the colored people he knew were shiftless characters.
We got very candid replies: the common opinion
being that about five out of twenty still had a notion of living
without work. Yet, curiously enough, not one would admit
that <em>he</em> was one of the five,—every man and woman acknowledging
that labor was a universal duty and necessity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LI.<br /> <span class='large'>FREE LABOR IN MISSISSIPPI.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Thomas, Assistant-Commissioner of the Freedmen’s
Bureau for the State of Mississippi, stationed at Vicksburg,
gave the negroes more credit for industry than they
gave each other. In the large towns, to which vagrancy naturally
gravitates, one in four was probably a fair estimate of
the proportion of colored people unable or unwilling to earn
an honest livelihood. “But I am confident,” said the Colonel,
“there is no more industrious class of people anywhere than
the freedmen who have little homesteads of their own. The
colonies under my charge, working lands assigned them by
the government, have raised this year ten thousand bales of
cotton, besides corn and vegetables for their subsistence until
another harvest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Other well-informed and experienced persons corroborated
this statement. Dr. Warren, Superintendent of Freedmen’s
Schools in Mississippi, told me of a negro family, consisting of
one man, three women, and a half-grown girl, who took a lot
of five acres, which they worked entirely with shovel and hoe,
having no mule, and on which they had that season cleared
five hundred dollars, above all expenses. I heard of numerous
other well-authenticated instances of the kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Warren spoke of the great eagerness of the blacks to
buy or lease land, and have homes of their own. This he
said accounted in a great measure for their backwardness in
making contracts. He said to one intelligent freedman: “The
whites intend to compel you to hire out to them.” The latter
replied: “What if we should compel them to lease us lands?”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were other reasons why the blacks would not contract.
At Vicksburg, a gentleman who had been fifty miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>up the valley looking for a plantation, said to me: “The negroes
everywhere I went have been shamefully abused. They
had been promised that if they would remain and work the
plantations, they should have a share of the crops; and now
the planters refuse to give them anything. They have no
confidence in Southern men, and will not hire out to them;
but they are very eager to engage with Northern men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the universal testimony, not only of travellers, but
of candid Southern planters. One of the latter class explained
to me how it was that the freedman was cheated out of his
share of the crop. After the cotton is sent to market, the
proprietor calls up his negroes, and tells them he has “furnished
them such and such things, for which he has charged
so much, and that there are no profits to divide. The darkey
don’t understand it,—he has kept no accounts; but he knows
he has worked hard and got nothing. He won’t hire to that
man again. But I, and any other man who has done as he
agreed with his niggers, can hire now as many as we want.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Thomas assured me that two thirds of the laborers
in the State had been cheated out of their wages during the
past year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. C——, a Northern man who had taken a plantation at ——,
(I omit names, for he told me that not only his property
but his life depended upon the good-will of his neighbors,) related
to me his experience. He hired his plantation of a gentleman
noted for his honesty: “He goes by the name of
‘Honest M——’ all through the country. But honesty
appeared to be a virtue to be exercised only towards white
people: it was too good to be thrown away on niggers. This
M—— has four hundred sheep, seventy milch cows, fifteen
horses, ten mules, and forty hogs, all of which were saved
from the Yankees when they raided through the country, by
an old negro who run them off across a swamp. Honest M——
has never given that negro five cents. Another of his slaves
had a cow of his own from which he raised a fine pair of
oxen: Honest M—— lays claim to those oxen and sells them.
A slave-woman that belonged to him had a cow she had raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>from a calf: Honest M—— takes that, and adds it to his herd.
He promised his niggers a share of the crops this year; but he
has sold the cotton, and locked up the corn, and never given
one of them a dollar. And all this time he thinks he is honest:
he thinks Northern capitalists treat free laborers in this way.
You can’t get it through the heads of these Southern planters
that the laboring class has any rights.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Honest M—— has two plantations,” continued Mr. C——:
“he rents me one of them. But he gave me notice at the
start that he should take all the niggers from my plantation,
and that I must look out for my own help. When I went
to take possession I was astonished to find the niggers all
there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’How’s this?’ I said. ‘I thought these people were
going with you?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said he couldn’t induce one of them to contract; and
he had about given up the idea of running his other plantation,
because the niggers wouldn’t work. He had offered
twenty-five dollars a month, with board and medical attendance,
and they wouldn’t engage to him even for that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Well,’ said I, ‘if you have got through I should like to
hire them.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said I was welcome to try. They knew me to be a
Northern man, and when I called them around me for a talk,
they all came with grinning faces. Said I: ‘Mr. M—— offers
you twenty-five dollars a month. That is more than I can
afford to pay, and I think you’d better hire to him.’ They
looked stolid: they couldn’t see it: they didn’t want to work
for him at any price.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I said, ‘If you won’t work for him, will you
work for me?’ I never saw faces light up so in my life.
‘Yes, master! Yes, master!’ ‘But,’ said I, ‘ten dollars a
month is all I can afford to pay.’ That made no difference,
they said; they’d rather work for ten dollars, and be sure of
their pay, than for twenty-five dollars, and be cheated out of
it. I gave them a day to think of it: then they all came forward
and made contracts, with one exception. They went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>right to work with a will: I won’t ask men to do any better
than they have been doing. They are having their Christmas
frolic now, and it’s as merry a Christmas as ever you saw!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I met with many planters in the situation of Honest M——.
Having made arrangements to run their plantations, and got in
the necessary supplies, they had discovered that “the niggers
wouldn’t contract.” They were then trying to lease their
lands to Northern capitalists.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have seldom met a more anxious, panic-stricken set of
men than the planters I saw on the steamer going down to
Vicksburg to hire freedmen. Observing the success of Northern
men, they had suddenly awakened to the great fact that,
although slavery was lost, all was not lost, and that there was
still a chance to make something out of the nigger. They
could not hire their own freedmen, and were going to see
what could be effected with freedmen to whom they were not
known. Each seemed to fear lest his neighbor should get
the start of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’re just crazy about the niggers,” said one, a Mississippian,
who was about the craziest of the set,—“crazy to
get hold of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” I remarked, “they say the freedmen won’t work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, they won’t,” said my Mississippi friend, unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then what do you want of them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I found everybody else was going in for hiring ’em,
and if anything was to be made, I didn’t want to be left out
in the cold.” Adding with great candor and earnestness: “<em>If
everybody else would have refused to hire ’em anyhow, that would
have just suited me: I’d have been willing to let my plantation
go to the devil for one year, just to see the free niggers starve.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw this gentleman afterwards in Vicksburg, and was not
deeply grieved to learn that he had failed to engage a single
freedman. “They are hiring to Northern men,” said he, bitterly;
“but they won’t hire to Southern men anyhow, if they
can help it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you account for this singular fact?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>“I don’t know. They’ve no confidence in us; but they
imagine the Yankees will do wonders by ’em. The Southern
people are really their best friends.” At which stereotyped
bit of cant I could not forbear a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The usual terms proposed by the planters were one hundred
and fifty dollars, for a full hand, payable at the end of the
year; together with doctors’ bills, two hundred pounds of
pork, and a peck of meal a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms most approved by Colonel Thomas were as follows:
Fifteen dollars a month, with food, including flour,
sugar, and molasses; a little patch of ground for each family,
and Saturday afternoon, for the raising of their own vegetables;
the freedmen to clothe themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The planters insisted on furnishing all needful supplies, and
charging the blacks for them when not stipulated for in the
contract. The alleged reason for this was that the negroes, if
allowed to buy their own supplies, would spend half their time
in running about the country for knick-knacks. But the better
class of planters admitted that the system was liable to gross
abuse. “I have neighbors,” said one, “who keep stores of
plain goods and fancy articles for their people; and, let a nigger
work ever so hard, and earn ever so high wages, he is
sure to come out in debt at the end of the year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who had given the free-labor system a fair trial admitted
that the negro would work as well as ever before, while
in the field,—some said better; but he would not work as
many hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many hours did he formerly work?” I inquired;
and received the following statement with regard to what was
done on a well-regulated Mississippi plantation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. P——’s niggers were in the field at daylight. It was
so in the longest days of summer, as at other times of the year.
They worked till six o’clock, when their breakfast was carried
to them. They had just time enough allowed them to eat their
breakfast; then they worked till noon, when their dinner was
carried to them. They had an hour for their dinner. At six
o’clock their supper was carried to them. Then they worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>till dark. There were cisterns in the field, where they got
their water. Nobody was allowed to leave the field from the
time they entered it in the morning until work was over at
night. That was to save time. The women who suckled
babies had their babies carried to them. A little nigger-boy
used to drive a mule to the field with a cart full of nigger
babies; and the women gave the brats their luncheon while
they ate their own. So not a minute was lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And this was the plantation of a “liberal” owner, worked
by a “considerate and merciful overseer.” It appeared, according
to the planters’ own statements, that their slaves used
to work at least sixteen hours a day in summer,—probably
more, for they had chores to do at home after dark. That
they should not choose to keep up such a continual strain on
their bodily faculties, now that they were free, did not appear
to me very unreasonable,—but that was perhaps because I
was prejudiced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the old system, many plantations were left entirely
to the management of overseers, the owners living in some
pleasant town where they enjoyed the advantages of society
for themselves and of schools for their children. The overseer
who could produce the most cotton to the hand was in great
request, and commanded the highest wages. The natural
result was that both lands and negroes were often worked to a
ruinous excess. But the occupation of these best overseers
was now gone. Not a freedman would hire out to work on
plantations where they were known to be employed. Some
managed, however, to avoid being thrown out of business by
attaching themselves to other plantations, and changing their
title. With the negroes a name is imposing. Many would
engage cheerfully to work under a “superintendent,” who
would not have entered the field under an “overseer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is easier to change an odious name than an odious
character. Said a candid Southern planter to me, “I should
get along very well with my niggers, if I could only get my
superintendent to treat them decently. Instead of cheering
and encouraging them, he bullies and scolds them, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>so far forgets himself as to kick and beat them. Now
they are free they won’t stand it. They stood it when they
were slaves, because they had to. He can’t get the notion
out of his head that they are still somehow slaves. When I
see things going right badly, I take him, and give him a good
talking to. Then for about three days he’ll use ’em better,
and everything goes smooth. But the first I know, there’s
more bullying and beating, and there’s more niggers bound to
quit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Christmas holidays were effecting a change
in the prospects of free labor for the coming year. I never
witnessed in so short a time so complete a revolution in public
feeling. One day it seemed that everybody was in despair,
complaining that the niggers wouldn’t work; the next,
everybody was rushing to employ them. And the freedmen,
who, before Christmas, had refused to make contracts, vaguely
hoping that lands would be given them by the government, or
leased to them by their owners, now came forward to make
the best terms they could. The presence of the Bureau at
this time in the South was an incalculable benefit to both parties.
It inspired the freedmen with confidence, and persuaded
them, with the promise of its protection, to hire out once more
to the Southern planters. The trouble was, that there was not
labor enough in the State to supply the demand. Many negroes
had enlisted in the war; others had wandered back to
the slave-breeding States from which they had been sold;
others had become small proprietors; and others had died, in
consequence of the great and sudden change in their circumstances
which the war had brought about.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LII.<br /> <span class='large'>A RECONSTRUCTED STATE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It seemed impossible for the people of Mississippi—and the
same may be said of the Southern people generally—to understand
the first principle of the free-labor system. Their
notions of it were derived from what they had seen of the
shiftless poor whites about them, demoralized by an institution
that rendered labor disreputable. They could not conceive of
a man devoting himself voluntarily to hard manual toil, such
as they had never seen performed except under the lash.
Some compulsory system seemed to them indispensable.
Hence the new black codes passed by the reconstructed legislatures
of several States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mississippi, like South Carolina, on returning to the fold of
the Union, from which those innocent lambs had strayed, made
haste to pass apprentice laws, vagrant laws, and laws relating
to contracts and labor, designed to bring back the freedmen
under the planters’ control. “An Act to regulate the Relation
of Master and Apprentice,” passed in November, 1865, provides
that “all freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes, under
the age of eighteen, who are orphans,” or are not maintained
by their parents, shall be apprenticed “to some competent and
suitable person,”—the former owner to “have the preference;”
that “the said apprentices shall be bound by indenture,
in the case of males until they are twenty-one years old,
and in case of females until they are eighteen years old”;
that said master or mistress shall have power to inflict “moderate
corporal chastisement”; that in case the apprentice
leaves them without their consent, he may be committed to
jail, and “<em>punished as provided for the punishment of hired
freedmen, as may be from time to time provided for by law</em>,”—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>meaning of which is clear, although the grammatical construction
is muddy; and that any person who shall employ,
feed, or clothe an apprentice who has deserted his master,
“shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor,” and so forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that, by this act, (approved November 22d,
1865,) not merely children without means of support may be
thus bound out under a modified system of slavery, but that
young girls, and lads of from fourteen to eighteen, capable not
only of supporting themselves, but of earning perhaps the
wages of a man or woman, may be taken from the employment
of their choice and compelled to serve without wages
the master or mistress assigned them by the court.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An Act to amend the Vagrant Laws of the State” provides
that “all freedmen over the age of eighteen years, found
on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, with
no lawful employment or business,” (as if no man was ever
honestly without employment,) “or found unlawfully assembling
themselves together either in the day or night time,
shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be
fined in the sum of not exceeding fifty dollars, and imprisoned
at the discretion of the court not exceeding ten days”; provided,
however, that in case any freedman “shall fail for five
days after the imposition of said fine to pay the same, that it
shall be, and is hereby, made the duty of the sheriff of the
proper county to hire out said freedman to any person who
will for the shortest period of service pay said fine or forfeiture
and all costs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A bill “To confer Civil Rights on Freedmen, and for other
Purposes,” enacts “That all freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes
may sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded in all the
courts of law and equity of this State, and may acquire personal
property and choses in action, by descent or purchase,
and may dispose of the same, in the same manner, and to the
same extent that white persons may: <em>Provided that the provisions
of this section shall not be so construed as to allow any
freedman, free negro, or mulatto to rent or lease any lands or
tenements, except in incorporated towns and cities.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Not to speak of the gross injustice of this last provision,
what shall be said of the wisdom of that legislation which prohibits
an entire laboring class from acquiring real estate in the
country, where their presence and energies are indispensable,
and holds out an inducement for them to flock to the towns,
which are crowded with them already, but where alone they
can hope to become freeholders?</p>

<p class='c000'>Another section of this bill enacts that freedmen shall be
competent witnesses in all cases where freedmen are parties to
the suit, or where a crime is alleged to have been committed
by a white person upon the person or property of a freedman.
But it does not give them the power to testify in cases in which
only white persons are concerned. All the negro testimony
bills which I have seen, passed by the legislatures of the reconstructed
States under gentle pressure from Washington,
are marked by this singular inconsistency. If the negro is a
competent witness in cases in which his own or his fellow’s
interests are involved, he is certainly a competent witness in
cases involving only the interests of white persons. He is
permitted to give evidence when there may exist a temptation
for him to swear falsely, and not when there is no such
temptation. By the enactment of such laws the whites are
in reality legislating against themselves. Even Governor
Humphreys—late Rebel general, but now the reconstructed
executive of the “loyal” State of Mississippi, elected for his
services in the Confederate cause—in his message to this
same legislature, favoring the admission of negroes into the
courts as an indispensable step towards ridding the State of
the military power, and of “that black incubus, the Freedman’s
Bureau,” made this suggestive statement:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are few men living in the South who have not
known many white criminals to go ‘unwhipt of justice’ because
negro testimony was not permitted in the courts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The act “To confer Civil Rights on the Freedmen,” proceeds
to make the following provisions, which look much more like
wrongs: “That every freedman, free negro, and mulatto
shall, on the second Monday of January, one thousand eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>hundred and sixty-six, and annually thereafter, have a lawful
home or employment,” (of course on any terms that may be
offered him,) “and shall have written evidence thereof, as
follows, to wit: If living in any incorporated city, town, or
village, a license from the Mayor thereof; and if living outside
of any incorporated city, town, or village, from the member of
the Board of Police of his beat, authorizing him or her to
do irregular and job work, or a written contract, as provided
in section sixth of this act; which licenses may be revoked for
cause, at any time, by the authority granting the same.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Section sixth enacts: “That all contracts for labor made
with freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes, for a longer period
than one month, shall be in writing and in duplicate; ... and
said contracts shall be taken and held as entire contracts;
and if the laborer shall quit the service of the employer before
expiration of his term of service, without good cause, he shall
forfeit his wages for that year up to the time of quitting.” But
who is to be the judge with regard to the “good cause?”
The white man, of course, and not the negro.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Section 7. Be it further enacted, That every civil officer
shall, and every person may, arrest and carry back to his or
her legal employer any freedman, free negro, or mulatto, who
shall have quit the service of his or her employer before the
expiration of his or her term of service.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Section ninth provides that if any person “<em>shall knowingly
employ any such deserting freedman, free negro, or mulatto, or
shall knowingly give or sell to any such deserting freedman, free
negro, or mulatto any food, raiment, or other thing, he or she
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be
fined not less than twenty-five dollars, and not more than two
hundred dollars and the costs</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These extracts—which I have made verbatim from an authorized
copy of the recent State laws, with only such abridgments
as were necessary to compress them within reasonable
limits—show plainly enough what ideas prevail in the late
Slave States on the subject of free labor. The design of all
such enactments is simply to place both the labor and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>laborer in the power of the employer, and to reorganize slavery
under a new name. The fact that they are practically set
aside and annulled by the military power and the Freedmen’s
Bureau, does not set aside or annul the spirit which dictated
them. This still animates the people of the South; and I was
often plainly told that as soon as the States were fully restored
to their rights, just such laws as these would certainly be put in
force. I remarked to a Mississippi planter, “Do you not think
it was unwise for your Legislature to pass such a code of laws?”
“Yes, it was unwise, <em>at this time</em>,” he replied, not understanding
the scope of my question. “<em>We showed our hand too soon.</em>
We ought to have waited till the troops were withdrawn, and
our representatives admitted to Congress; then we could have
had everything our own way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the admission of negro testimony in the civil courts
of the State, the freedmen’s courts had been discontinued,—greatly
to the disadvantage of the colored race. The civil
courts could hardly be induced to give the negro’s cause a
hearing. There were some exceptions; and at Vicksburg I
found a judge who seemed inclined to administer justice without
regard to the prejudice against color. This was Judge
Yerger, an original Union man,—one of the seven (against
seventy-eight) who voted No, on the adoption of the ordinance
of secession in the Convention of 1861; the same who, when
asked by a member what title should be given to that act, replied,
“Call it <em>An Ordinance for the Abolition of Slavery and
the Desolation of the South</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yerger was the President of the new Convention that reconstructed
the State. That Convention was animated by a very
different temper from that shown by the new Legislature. The
Convention was composed of the best men in Mississippi, who
went prepared to do what the Government at Washington had a
right to expect of rebellious States returning to their allegiance;
the Legislature was made up of a different class, elected after
the people of the South had been encouraged in their animosity
and arrogance by the discovery that treason was not to be
punished, nor made particularly odious. The Convention was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>governed by men of large influence and liberal views; the
Legislature was controlled by narrow-minded intermeddlers,
mostly from the poorer districts of the State, where the inhabitants
hated the negroes the more by way of revenge for having
owned so few.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was claimed by the better class that the Legislature did
not represent them, and there was talk of calling another State
Convention. But the Legislature, although it did not carry
out the views of the more enlightened and progressive citizens,
nor reflect in any way the sentiments of the great mass of true
Union men in the South, namely, the blacks, represented quite
faithfully the majority by which it was elected.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already alluded to the organizing of the State
militia,—an abuse that unfortunately received the sanction
of the Administration. The only possible excuse for it was
the cry raised regarding anticipated negro insurrections. To
guard against danger from a class whose loyalty and good
behavior during the war challenged the admiration of the
world, arms were put into the hands of Confederate soldiers
who had returned to their homes reeking with the
blood of the nation. Power was taken from the friends
of the government and put into the hands of its enemies.
The latter immediately set to work disarming the former.
They plundered their houses, under the pretence of searching
for weapons; committing robberies, murders, and other atrocities,
with authentic reports of which pages might be filled.
Neither were white men, known to sympathize with the Union
party of the North, safe from their violence. Governor Humphreys
himself, startled by the magnitude of the evil that had
been called into existence, told Colonel Thomas that he had
been obliged to disband several militia companies already organized,
“on learning that they were sworn to kill negroes
asserting their independence, and to drive off Northern men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of what was being done by private parties outside of the
militia organizations, a curious glimpse is given in the following
“general order,” published in the Holmesville (Miss.)
“Independent”:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“In obedience to an order of His Excellency, the Governor of
Mississippi, I have this day assumed command of all the militia in
this section of the State, with head-quarters at this place. And
whereas it has been reported to me that there are various individuals,
not belonging to any military organization, either State or Federal,
who are engaged in shooting at, and sometimes killing, the freedmen
on private account; and whereas there are other white men
reported as the attendants of, and participants in, the negro balls, who,
after placing themselves upon a social equality with the people of
color, raise quarrels with the freedmen, upon questions of social
superiority already voluntarily waived and relinquished by them in
favor of the negro, by which the peace of the country is broken and
the law disregarded; I therefore order the arrest of all such offenders,
by the officers and soldiers under my command, and that they be
taken before some civil officer having power to commit to the county
jail, for the purpose of awaiting the action of the Grand Jury.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Q. M. G. and Col. Com. Militia.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The objection here seems to be to shooting the freedmen
“on private account,” or doing anything “illegally,” thus
taking the proper work of the militia out of its hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were no doubt serious apprehensions in the minds of
the people on the subject of negro insurrections. But a great
deal that was said about them was mere pretence and cant,
with which I have not seen fit to load these pages. There
was not, while I was in the South, the slightest danger from
a rising of the blacks, nor will there be, unless they are driven
to desperation by wrongs.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember two very good specimens of formidable negro
insurrections. One was reported in Northern Mississippi, and
investigated personally by General Fiske, who took pains to
visit the spot and learn all the facts concerning it. According
to his account, “a colored man hunting squirrels was magnified
into a thousand vicious negroes marching upon their old masters
with bloody intent.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The other case was reported at the hotel in Vicksburg
where I stopped, by a gentleman who had just arrived in the
steamer “Fashion” from New Orleans. He related an exciting
story of a rising of the blacks in Jefferson Parish, and a
great slaughter of the white population. He also stated that
General Sheridan had sent troops to quell the insurrection.
Afterwards, when at New Orleans, I made inquiry of General
Sheridan concerning the truth of the rumor, and learned that
it was utterly without foundation. The most noticeable phase
of it was the effect it had upon the guests at the hotel table.
Everybody had been predicting negro insurrections at Christmas-time;
now everybody’s prophecy had come true, and
everybody was delighted. A good deal of horror was expressed;
but the real feeling, ill-concealed under all, was
exultation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will Sumner &amp; Co. say now?” cried one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only way is to kill the niggers off, and drive ’em out
of the country,” said another.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was struck by the perfect unanimity with which the company
indorsed this last sentiment. All the outrages committed
by whites upon blacks were of no account; but at the mere
rumor of a negro insurrection, what murderous passions were
roused!</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the comparative good behavior of whites and blacks in
a large town, the police reports afford a pretty good indication.
Vicksburg, which had less than five thousand inhabitants
in 1860, had in 1865 fifteen thousand. Of these, eight
thousand were blacks. On Christmas-day, out of nineteen
persons brought before the police court for various offences,
fourteen were white and five colored. The day after there
were ten cases reported,—nine white persons and one negro.
The usual proportion of white criminals was more than two
thirds.</p>

<p class='c000'>An unrelenting spirit of persecution, shown towards Union
men in Mississippi, was fostered by the reconstructed civil
courts. Union scouts were prosecuted for arson and stealing.
A horse which had been taken by the government, and afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>condemned and sold, was claimed by the original owner,
and recovered,—the quartermaster’s bill of sale, produced in
court by the purchaser, being pronounced null and void. The
government had leased to McAlister, a Northern man, an
abandoned plantation, with the privilege of cutting wood upon
it, for which he paid forty cents a cord: the Rebel owner returns
with his pardon, and sues the lessee for alleged damages
done to his property by the removal of wood, to the amount
of five thousand dollars; a writ of attachment issues under
the seal of the local court, and the defendant is compelled to
give bonds to the amount of ten thousand dollars, or lie in
jail. Such cases were occurring every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beautiful effect of executive mercy upon rampant Rebels
was well illustrated in Mississippi. A single example will
suffice. The Reverend Dr. ——, an eloquent advocate of
the Confederate cause,—who, as late as March 23d, 1865,
delivered a speech before the State Legislature, urging the
South to fight to the last extremity,—under strong pretences
of loyalty, obtained last summer a full pardon, and an order
for the restoration of his property. The —— House, in
Vicksburg, belonging to this reverend gentleman, was at that
time used as a hospital for colored persons by the Freedmen’s
Bureau. Returning, with the President’s authority, he turned
out the sick inmates with such haste as to cause the deaths
of several; and on the following Sunday preached a vehement
sermon on reconstruction, in which he avowed himself
a better friend to the blacks than Northern men, and declared
that it was “the duty of the government to treat the South
with magnanimity, because it was not proper for a living ass
to kick a dead lion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was great opposition to the freedmen’s schools. Dr.
Warren, the superintendent for the State, told me that “if
the Bureau was withdrawn not a school would be publicly
allowed.” There were combinations formed to prevent the
leasing of rooms for schools; and those who would have been
willing to let buildings for this purpose were deterred from
doing so by threats of vengeance from their neighbors. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Vicksburg, school-houses had been erected on confiscated land,
which had lately been restored to the Rebel owners, and from
which they were ordered, with other government buildings, to
be removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the month of November there were 4750 pupils in the
freedmen’s schools,—the average attendance being about
3000. Of these, 2650 were advanced beyond the alphabet
and primer; 1200 were learning arithmetic, and 1000 writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The schools were mainly supported by the Indiana Yearly
Meeting of Friends, the Ohio Yearly Meeting, the American
Freedmen’s Aid Commission, (composed of various denominations,)
and the American Missionary Association, (Congregational.)
Elkanah Beard, of the Indiana Yearly Meeting, was
the first to organize a colony of colored refugees in Mississippi,
and through him his society have furnished to the freedmen
practical relief, in the shape of food, clothing, and shelter, to a
very great amount. The United Presbyterian Body had fifteen
teachers at Vicksburg and Davis’s Bend. The Old School
Presbyterian Church had a missionary at Oxford, introducing
schools upon plantations, and the Moravian Church had a pioneer
at Holly Springs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A FEW WORDS ABOUT COTTON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The best cotton lands in the States lie between 31° and 36°
north latitude. Below 31° the climate is too moist, causing the
plant to run too much to stalk, and the fibre to rot. Above
36° the season is too short and too cold. The most fertile tracts
for the cultivation of cotton are the great river bottoms. In
the Mississippi Valley, twice or even three or four times as
much may be raised to the acre as in Northern Alabama
or Middle Tennessee. But in the Valley there is danger
from floods and the army worm, by which sometimes entire
crops are swept away. On the uplands there is danger from
drought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The life of the planter is one of care and uncertainty. It
requires almost as extensive organization to run a large plantation
as a factory. You never know, until the crop is picked,
whether you are going to get fifty or five hundred pounds to
the acre. Anxiety begins at planting-time. The weather may
be too wet; it may be too dry; and the question eagerly asked
is, “Will you have a stand?” If the “stand” is favorable,—that
is, if the plants come up well, and get a good start,—you
still watch the weather, lest they may not have drink
enough, or the levees, lest they may have too much. Look
out also for the destructive insects: kindle fires in your fields
to poison with smoke the moths that lay the eggs; and scatter
corn to call the birds, that they may feed upon the newly-hatched
worms. Perhaps, when the cotton is just ready to
come out, a storm of rain and wind beats it down into the mud.
Then, when the crop is harvested, it is liable to be burned;
and you must think of your insurance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding these disadvantages, there is great fascination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>in the culture,—the possibility of clearing in one season
from a good plantation fifty or a hundred thousand dollars,
causing you to take cheerfully all risks. The plausible figures
dazzle you; and to the Northern man the novelty of the
life in prospect for a year or two is itself an inducement.
You think little of the danger to health from the miasmas of
the swamps; or to property, from the midnight torch of an
enemy; or to life, from the ill-timed recreation of some bushwhacking
neighbor. And you are quite insensible to what
the Southern planter deems the greatest of all risks that beset
your crop,—that some day your freedmen will desert, and
leave it to destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found many Northern planters in the upland districts of
Alabama and Tennessee, where lands are cheaper, plantations
smaller, and the risks less, than in the Mississippi Valley. But
the latter region proved the greater attraction to adventurous
capital. Men from the Middle States and the great West
were everywhere, buying and leasing plantations, hiring freedmen,
and setting thousands of ploughs in motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>From experienced cotton-growers I obtained various estimates
of the cost and probable profits of a crop the present
year. They usually differed little as to items of expense, but
sometimes very widely as to profits, according to each man’s
conjectures regarding freedmen’s willingness to work, and
the price of cotton next fall, which one would place as low
as fifteen cents, and another as high as fifty. The annexed
statement, furnished by the Southern Land Agency at Vicksburg,
is probably as good as any:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir:—The following is an estimate of the expense and cash
capital required to cultivate 500 acres of cotton land within the scope
of our agency, for the year 1866.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From which calculation we see that the <em>actual cash capital required</em>
is $16,769, or about $33 per acre, and the <em>actual expense</em>
about $42 per acre. But as men’s financial abilities differ materially,
we think it quite possible to cultivate land with smaller capital.
Many are hiring men, agreeing to pay but a small portion of their
wages monthly, and the balance at the end of the year; while others
save the use of capital by procuring supplies on a short credit, or by
allowing a portion of the crop for rent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The average crop on alluvial land is full one bale per acre; on
second bottom or table lands, about ⅔ bale, and on uplands ½ bale.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Clothing and extra supplies furnished to hands are usually
charged against their wages.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This calculation is considered by the most experienced cotton-growers
in the country a fair and liberal estimate; and from it you
may estimate the profit on any sized tract, as the difference in the
amount of land tilled will not materially change the figures.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Here the cost of some articles is placed too low. Two hundred
dollars each for mules would be nearer the actual price.
The cotton-seed to be replaced by the crop should also be
thrown out of the consideration if you expect to close up business
at the end of the year, for although seed this season
brought one dollar and upwards, it has no merchantable value
in ordinary times. This you will take into account if intending
to undertake a plantation next year.</p>

<p class='c000'>But suppose we call the total expenditure for this year
twenty-four thousand dollars. And suppose a full crop is produced,—five
hundred acres yielding an equal number of bales.
Taking twenty-five cents a pound as a safe estimate, you have
for each bale (of five hundred pounds) $125; for five hundred
bales, $62,500. From this gross amount deduct the total expenditure,
and you have remaining $38,500. If you go to
the uplands where less cotton is produced, you employ fewer
hands, and have less rent to pay,—perhaps not more than four
or five dollars for good land. Should cotton be as low as twenty
cents, you have still a fair margin for profits; and should it
be as high as fifty, as many confidently maintain it will be,
the resulting figures are sufficiently exciting.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1850 Mississippi produced 484,292 bales, of 400 pounds
each; in 1860, more than twice that quantity. The present
year, notwithstanding the scarcity of labor and the number of
unprotected and desolated plantations, there is a prospect of
two thirds of an average crop,—say half a million bales.
The freedmen are working well; and cotton is cultivated to
the neglect of almost everything else. If we have a good
cotton season, there will be a large yield. If there is a small
yield, the price will be proportionately high. So that in either
case the crop raised in Mississippi this year bids fair to produce
forty or fifty million dollars.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LIV.<br /> <span class='large'>DAVIS’S BEND.—GRAND GULF.—NATCHEZ.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Descending the Mississippi, the first point of interest you
pass is Davis’s Bend, the former home of the President of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A curve of the river encircles a pear-shaped peninsula
twenty-eight miles in circumference, with a cut-off across the
neck seven hundred yards in length, converting it into an
island. There is a story told of a man who, setting out to
walk on the levee to Natchez, from Mr. Joe Davis’s plantation,
which adjoins that of his brother Jeff, unwittingly made
the circuit of this island, and did not discover his mistake until
he found himself at night on the spot from which he had
started in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a mile from the river stands the Jeff Davis Mansion,
with its wide verandas and pleasant shade-trees. The
plantation comprises a thousand acres of tillable land, now
used as a Home Farm for colored paupers, under the superintendence
of a sub-commissioner of the Bureau. Here are
congregated the old, the orphaned, the infirm, and many whose
energies of body and mind were prematurely worn out under
the system which the Confederacy was designed to glorify and
perpetuate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here you find the incompetent and thriftless. Some have
little garden-spots, on which they worked last season until
their vegetables were ripe, when they stopped work and went
to eating the vegetables. The government cultivates cotton
with their labor; and once, at a critical period, it was necessary
to commence ejecting them from their quarters in order
to compel them to work to keep the grass down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen on the other plantations of the island represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>other qualities of the race. Besides the Home Farm
there are five thousand acres divided into farms and homesteads,
cultivated by the negroes on their own account, and
paying a large rent to the government. On these little farms
twenty-five hundred bales of cotton were raised last year, besides
large quantities of corn, potatoes, and other produce.
Many of the tenants had only their naked hands to begin with:
they labored with hoes alone the first year, earning money to
buy mules and ploughs the next. The signal success of the
colony perhaps indicates the future of free labor in the South,
and the eventual division of the large plantations into homesteads
to be sold or rented to small farmers. This system suits
the freedman better than any other; and under it he is industrious,
prosperous, and happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were about three thousand people at the Bend. Some
worked a few acres, others took large farms, and hired laborers.
Fifty had accumulated five thousand dollars each during the
past two years; and one hundred others had accumulated
from one to four thousand dollars. Some of these rising capitalists
had engaged Northern men to rent plantations for the
coming year, and to take them in as partners,—the new black
code of Mississippi prohibiting the leasing of lands to the freedmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colony is self-governing, under the supervision of the
sub-commissioner. There are three courts, each having its
colored judge and sheriff. The offender, before being put on
trial, can decide whether he will be tried by a jury, or have
his case heard by the judge alone. Pretty severe sentences
are sometimes pronounced; and it is found that the negro will
take cheerfully twice the punishment from one of his own color
that he will from a white court.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some sound sense often falls from the lips of these black
Solomons. Here is a sample. A colored man and his mother
are brought up for stealing a bag of corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Judge</em>: “Do you choose to be tried by a jury?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Culprit</em> (not versed in the technicalities of the court):
“What’s dat?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span><em>Judge</em>: “Do you want twelve men to come in and help
me?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Culprit</em>, emphatically: “No, sah!”—for he thinks one
man will probably be too much for him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Judge</em>, sternly: “Now listen you! You and your mother
are a couple of low-down darkies, trying to get a living without
work. You are the cause that respectable colored people
are slandered, and called thieving and lazy niggers; when it’s
only the likes of you that’s thieving and lazy. Now this is
what I’ll do with you. If you and your mother will hire out
to-day, and go to work like honest people, I’ll let you off on
good behavior. If you won’t, I’ll send you to Captain Norton.
That means, you’ll go up with a sentence. And I’ll
tell you what your sentence will be: three months’ hard labor
on the Home Farm, and the ball and chain in case you attempt
to run away. Now which will you do?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Culprit</em>, eagerly: “I’ll hire out, sah!” And a contract is
made for him and his mother on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next point of interest is Grand Gulf; the only place
that offered any resistance to our gun-boats between Vicksburg
and Port Hudson. It had before the war a thousand inhabitants,
three churches, and several steam-mills. Water and fire
appear to have conspired against it. The Yankees burned
every vestige of the village, and the river has torn away a
large section of the bank on which it stood. A number of
cheap whitewashed wooden buildings have taken its place on
the shore; above and behind which rises a steep rocky bluff,
covered with sparse timber, sedge, and cane-brakes, and crowned
by Rebel batteries.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was formerly an extensive whirlpool below the confluence
of the Big Black with the Mississippi, which had worn
a gulf six hundred feet deep, just above this place: hence its
name, Grand Gulf. This immense chasm has been filled, since
the beginning of the war, by the river that excavated it; and
where the whirlpool was there is now a solid sand-bar overgrown
with cotton-wood bushes. Opposite the town, on the
Louisiana side, there is another sand-bar, bare and low, occupying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the place of a fine plantation that flourished there before
the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hundred and twenty miles below Vicksburg is Natchez,
one of the most romantically and beautifully situated cities in
the United States. It is built on an almost precipitous bluff,
one hundred and fifty feet above the river, which is overlooked
by a delightful park and promenade along the city front. The
landing is under the bluff.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Quitman” (in which I had taken passage) stopped
several hours at Natchez getting on board a quantity of cotton.
Above Vicksburg, I noticed that nearly all the cotton
was going northward: below, it was going the other way,
toward New Orleans. At every town, and at nearly every
plantation landing, we took on board, sometimes a hundred
bales and more, sometimes but two or three, until the “Quitman”
showed two high white walls of cotton all round her
guards, which were sunk to the water’s edge. She was constructed
to carry forty-three hundred bales.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the levee at Natchez I made the acquaintance of an
old plantation overseer. He knew all about cotton raising.
“I’ve overseed in the swamps, and I’ve overseed on the
hills. You can make a bale to the acre in the swamps, and
about one bale to two acres on the hills. I used to get ten to
fifteen hundred dollars a year. I’m hiring now to a Northern
man, who gives me three thousand. A Northern man will
want to get more out of the niggers than we do. Mine said
to me last night, ‘I want you to get the last drop of sweat and
the last pound of cotton out of my niggers;’ and I shall do it.
I can if anybody can. There’s a heap in humbuggin’ a nigger.
I worked a gang this summer, and got as much work
out of ’em as I ever did. I just had my leading nigger, and
I says to him, I says, ‘Sam, I want this yer crop out by such
a time; now you go ahead, talk to the niggers, and lead ’em
off right smart, and I’ll give you twenty-five dollars.’ Then
I got up a race, and give a few dollars to the men that picked
the most cotton, till I found out the extent of what each man
could pick; then I required that of him every day, or I docked
his wages.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>As we were talking, the mate of the “Quitman” took up an
oyster-shell and threw it at the head of one of the deck-hands,
who did not handle the cotton to suit him. It did not hurt
the negro’s head much, but it hurt his feelings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Out on the plantations,” observed my friend the overseer,
“it would cost him fifty dollars to hit a nigger that way. It
cost me a hundred and fifty dollars just for knocking down
three niggers lately,—fifty dollars a piece, by ——!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought the negroes were going to be crowded out by
the Germans; and went on to say, with true Southern consistency,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Germans want twenty dollars a month, and we can
hire the niggers for ten and fifteen. The Germans will die in
our swamps. Then as soon as they get money enough to buy
a cart and mule, and an acre of land somewhar, whar they
can plant a grape-vine, they’ll go in for themselves.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We were nearly all night at Natchez loading cotton. The
next day, I noticed that the men worked languidly, and that
the mate was plying them with whiskey. I took an opportunity
to talk with him about them. He said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have a hundred and eighty hands aboard, all told.
Thar’s sixty deck-hands. That a’n’t enough. We ought to
have reliefs, when we’re shipping freight day and night as we
are now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I remarked: “A gentleman who came up to Vicksburg in
the ‘Fashion,’ stated, as an excuse for the long trip she made,
that the niggers wouldn’t work,—that the mates couldn’t
make them work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He replied: “I reckon the hands on board the ‘Fashion’
are about in the condition these are. These men are used up.
They ha’n’t had no sleep for four days and nights. I’ve seen
a man go to sleep many a time, standing up, with a box on his
shoulder. We pay sixty dollars a month,—more’n almost
any other boat, the work is so hard. But we get rid of paying
a heap of ’em. When a man gets so used up he can’t
stand no more, he quits. He don’t dare to ask for wages, for
he knows he’ll get none, without he sticks by to the end of
the trip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were talking, a young fellow, not more than
twenty years old, came up, looking very much exhausted, and
told the mate he was sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye a’n’t sick neither!” roared the mate at him, fiercely.
“You’re lazy! If you won’t work, go ashore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow limped away again, and went ashore at the next
landing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>“Is he sick or lazy?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neither. He’s used up. He was as smart a hand as I
had when he came aboard. But they can’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it always so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; before the war we had men trained for this work.
We had some niggers, but more white men. We couldn’t
git all the niggers we wanted; a fifteen hundred dollar man
wore out too quick.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The whites were the best, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The niggers was the best. They was more active getting
down bales. They liked the fun. They stand it better than
white men. Business stopped, and that set of hands all
dropped off,—went into the war, the most of ’em. Now we
have to take raw hands. These are all plantation niggers.
Not one of ’m’ll ship for another trip; they’ve had enough
of it. Thar’s no compellin’ ’em. You can’t hit a nigger
now, but these d——d Yankee sons of b——s have you up
and make you pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I told him if that was the case, I didn’t think I should hit
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ve never had me up,” he resumed. “When I
tackle a nigger, it’ll be whar thar an’t no witnesses, and it’ll
be the last of him. That’s what ought to be done with ’em,—kill
’em all off. I like a nigger in his place, and that’s a
servant, if thar’s any truth in the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This allusion to Scripture, from lips hot with words of wrath
and wrong, was especially edifying.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Quitman” was a fine boat, and passengers, if not
deck-hands, fared sumptuously on board of her. The table
was equal to that of the best hotels. An excellent quality of
claret wine was furnished, as a part of the regular dinner fare,
after the French fashion, which appears to have been introduced
into this country by the Creoles, and which is to be met
with, I believe, only on the steamboats of the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the “Quitman,” as on the boat from Memphis to Vicksburg,
I made the acquaintance of all sorts of Southern people.
The conversation of some of them is worth recording.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>One, a Mississippi planter, learning that I was a Northern
man, took me aside, and with much emotion, asked if I thought
there was “any chance of the government paying us for our
niggers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What niggers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The niggers you’ve set free by this abolition war.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This abolition war you brought upon yourselves; and
paying you for your slaves would be like paying a burglar for
a pistol lost on your premises. No, my friend, believe me,
you will never get the first cent, as long as this government
lasts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked deeply anxious. But he still cherished a hope.
“I’ve been told by a heap of our people that we shall get our
pay. Some are talking about buying nigger claims. They
expect, when our representatives get into Congress, there’ll
be an appropriation made.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went on: “I did one mighty bad thing. To save my
niggers, I run ’em off into Texas. It cost me a heap of
money. I came back without a dollar, and found the Yankees
had taken all my stock, and everything, and my niggers was
free, after all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Jim B——, from Warren County, ten miles from Vicksburg,
was a Mississippi planter of a different type,—jovial, generous,
extravagant in his speech, and, in his habits of living, fast.
“My niggers are all with me yet, and you can’t get ’em to
leave me. The other day my boy Dan drove me into town;
when we got thar, I says to him, ‘Dan, ye want any money?’
‘Yes, master, I’d like a little?’ I took out a ten-dollar bill
and give him. Another nigger says to him, ‘Dan, what did
that man give you money for?’ ‘That man?’ says Dan;
‘I belongs to him.’ ‘No, you don’t belong to nobody now;
you’re free.’ ‘Well,’ says Dan, ‘he provides for me, and gives
me money, and he’s my master, any way.’ I give my boys
a heap more money than I should if I just hired ’em. We go
right on like we always did, and I pole ’em if they don’t do
right. This year I says to ’em, ‘Boys, I’m going to make a
bargain with you. I’ll roll out the ploughs and the mules and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>the feed, and you shall do the work; we’ll make a crop of
cotton, and you shall have half. I’ll provide for ye, give ye
quarters, treat ye well, and when ye won’t work, pole ye like
I always have. They agreed to it, and I put it into the contract
that I was to whoop ’em when I pleased.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Jim was very enthusiastic about a girl that belonged to him.
“She’s a perfect mountain-spout of a woman!” (if anybody
knows what that is.) “When the Yankees took me prisoner,
she froze to a trunk of mine, and got it out of the way with
fifty thousand dollars Confederate money in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He never wearied of praising her fine qualities. “She’s
black outside, but she’s white inside, shore!” And he spoke
of a son of hers, then twelve years old, with an interest and
affection which led me to inquire about the child’s father.
“Well,” said Jim, with a smile, “he’s a perfect little image
of me, only a shade blacker.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An Arkansas planter said: “I’ve a large plantation near
Pine Bluff. I furnish everything but clothes, and give my
freedmen one third of the crop they make. On twenty plantations
around me, there are ten different styles of contracts.
Niggers are working well; but you can’t get only about two
thirds as much out of ’em now as you could when they were
slaves” (which I suppose is about all that ought to be got out
of them). “The nigger is fated: he can’t live with the white
race, now he’s free. I don’t know one I’d trust with fifty
dollars, or to manage a crop and control the proceeds. It will
be generations before we can feel friendly towards the Northern
people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I remarked: “I have travelled months in the South, and
expressed my sentiments freely, and met with better treatment
than I could have expected five years ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s true; if you had expressed abolition sentiments
then, you’d have woke up some morning and found yourself
hanging from some limb.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the war he said: “Slavery was really what we were
fighting for, although the leaders didn’t talk that to the people.
They saw the slave interest was losing power in the Union,
and trying to straighten it up, they tipped it over.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>A Louisiana planter, from Lake Providence,—and a very
intelligent, well-bred gentleman,—said: “Negroes do best
when they have a share of the crop; the idea of working
for themselves stimulates them. Planters are afraid to trust
them to manage; but it’s a great mistake. I know an old
negro who, with three children, made twenty-five bales of cotton
this year on abandoned land. Another, with two women
and a blind mule, made twenty-seven bales. A gang of fifty
made three hundred bales,—all without any advice or assistance
from white men. I was always in favor of educating
and elevating the black race. The laws were against it, but
I taught all my slaves to read the Bible. Each race has its
peculiarities: the negro has his, and it remains to be seen
what can be done with him. Men talk about his stealing: no
doubt he’ll steal: but circumstances have cultivated that habit.
Some of my neighbors couldn’t have a pig, but their niggers
would steal it. But mine never stole from me, because they
had enough without stealing. Giving them the elective franchise
just now is absurd; but when they are prepared for it,
and they will be some day, I shall advocate it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another Louisianian, agent of the Hope Estate, near Water-Proof,
in Tensas Parish, said: “I manage five thousand
acres,—fourteen hundred under cultivation. I always fed my
niggers well, and rarely found one that would steal. My
neighbors’ niggers, half-fed, hard-worked, they’d steal, and
I never blamed ’em. Nearly all mine stay with me. They’ve
done about two thirds the work this year they used to, for
one seventh of the crops. Heap of niggers around me have
never received anything; they’re only just beginning to learn
that they’re free. Many planters keep stores for niggers, and
sell ’em flour, prints, jewelry and trinkets, and charge two or
three prices for everything. I think God intended the niggers
to be slaves; we have the Bible for that:” always the Bible.
“Now since man has deranged God’s plan, I think the best we
can do is to keep ’em as near a state of bondage as possible.
I don’t believe in educating ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>“One reason, schooling would enable them to compete with
white mechanics.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be a <em>disadvantage</em> to the whites,” he replied,—as
if that was the only thing to be considered by men with the
Bible in their mouths! “In Mississippi, opposite Water-Proof,
there’s a minister collecting money to buy plantations in a
white man’s name, to be divided in little farms of ten and fifteen
acres for the niggers. He couldn’t do that thing in my
parish: he’d soon be dangling from some tree. There isn’t
a freedman taught in our parish; not a school; it wouldn’t
be allowed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He admitted that the war was brought on by the Southern
leaders, but thought the North “ought to be lenient and give
them all their rights.” Adding: “What we want chiefly is
to legislate for the freedmen. Another thing: the Confederate
debt ought to be assumed by the government. We shall
try hard for that. If we can’t get it, if the North continues
to treat us as a subjugated people, the thing will have to be
tried over again,”—meaning the war. “We must be left to
manage the nigger. He can’t be made to work without force.”
(He had just said his niggers did two thirds as much work as
formerly.) “My theory is, feed ’em well, clothe ’em well,
and then, if they won’t work, d—n ’em, whip ’em well!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I did not neglect the deck-passengers. These were all negroes,
except a family of white refugees from Arkansas, who
had been burnt out twice during the war, once near Little
Rock, and again in Tennessee, near Memphis. With the little
remnant of their possessions they were now going to seek
their fortunes elsewhere,—ill-clad, starved-looking, sleeping
on deck in the rain, coiled around the smoke-pipe, and covered
with ragged bedclothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The talk of the negroes was always entertaining. Here is
a sample, from the lips of a stout old black woman:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“De best ting de Yankees done was to break de slavery
chain. I shouldn’t be here to-day if dey hadn’t. I’m going
to see my mother.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>“Your mother must be very old.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may know she’s dat, for I’m one of her baby chil’n,
and I’s got ’leven of my own. I’ve a heap better time now
’n I had when I was in bondage. I had to nus’ my chil’n
four times a day and pick two hundred pounds cotton besides.
My third husband went off to de Yankees. My first was sold
away from me. Now I have my second husband again; I
was sold away from him, but I found him again, after I’d
lived with my third husband thirteen years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked if he was willing to take her back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was willing to have me again <em>on any terms</em>”—emphatically—“for
he knowed I was Number One!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Several native French inhabitants took passage at various
points along the river, below the Mississippi line. All spoke
very good French, and a few conversed well in English. One,
from Point Coupée Parish, said: “Before the war, there were
over seventeen thousand inhabitants in our parish.” (In Louisiana
a county is called a parish.) “Nearly thirteen thousand
were slaves. Many of the free inhabitants were colored;
so that there were about four colored persons to one white.
We made yearly between eight and nine thousand hogsheads
of sugar, and fifteen hundred bales of cotton. The war has
left us only three thousand inhabitants. We sent fifteen hundred
men into the Confederate army. All the French population
were in favor of secession. The white inhabitants of
these parishes are mostly French Creoles. We treated our slaves
better than the Americans treated theirs. We didn’t work
them so hard; and there was more familiarity and kindly feeling
between us and our servants. The children were raised
together; and a white child learned the negroes’ <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i> before
he learned French. The patois is curious: a negro says ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moi
pas connais</span></i>’ for ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne sais pas</span></i>’ (I do not know); and they
use a great many African words which you would not understand.
Our slaves were never sold except to settle an estate.
Besides these two classes there was a third, quite separate,
which did not associate with either of the others. They were
the free colored, of French-African descent, some almost or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>quite white, with many large property holders and slave-owners
among them; a very respectable class, forming a society of
their own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The villages and plantation dwellings along here, with their
low roofs and sunny verandas, on the level river bank, had a
peculiarly foreign and tropical appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The levees of Louisiana form a much more extensive and
complete system than those of Mississippi. In the latter State
there is much hilly land that does not need their protection,
and much swamp land not worth protecting; and there is, I
believe, no law regarding them. In the low and level State
of Louisiana, however, a large and fertile part of which lies
considerably below the level of high water, there is very strict
legislation on the subject, compelling every land-owner on the
river to keep up his levees. This year the State itself had
undertaken to repair them, issuing eight per cent. bonds to the
amount of a million dollars for the purpose,—the expense of
the work to be defrayed eventually by the planters.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a long distance the Lower Mississippi, at high water,
appears to be flowing upon a ridge. The river has built up its
own banks higher than the country which lies back of them;
and the levees have raised them still higher. Behind this fertile
strip there are extensive swamps, containing a soil of unsurpassed
depth and richness, but unavailable for want of drainage.
Three methods are proposed for bringing them under
cultivation. First, to surround them by levees, ditch them,
and pump the water out by steam. Second, to cut a canal
through them to the Gulf. Third, to turn the Mississippi into
them, and fill them with its alluvial deposit. This last method
is no doubt the one Nature intended to employ; and it is the
opinion of many that man, confining the flow of the stream
within artificial limits, attempted the settlement of this country
several centuries too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable feature of Louisiana scenery is its forests of
cypress-trees growing out of the water, heavy, sombre, and
shaggy with moss.</p>

<p class='c000'>The complexion of the river water is a light mud-color,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>which it derives from the turbid Missouri,—the Upper Mississippi
being a clear stream. Pour off a glass of it after it
has been standing a short time, and a sediment of dark mud
appears at the bottom. Notwithstanding this unpleasant peculiarity,
it is used altogether for cooking and drinking purposes
on board the steamboats, and I found New Orleans supplied
with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious fact has been suggested with regard to this wonderful
river,—that it <em>runs up hill</em>. Its mouth is said to be
two and a half miles higher—or farther from the earth’s centre—than
its source. When we consider that the earth is a
spheroid, with an axis shorter by twenty-six miles than its equatorial
diameter; and that the same centrifugal motion which
has caused the equatorial protuberance tends still to heap up
the waters of the globe where that motion is greatest; the
seeming impossibility appears possible,—just as we see a revolving
grindstone send the water on its surface to the rim.
Stop the grindstone, and the water flows down its sides. Stop
the earth’s revolution, and immediately you will see the Mississippi
River turn and flow the other way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years ago I made a voyage of several days on the
Upper Mississippi, to the head of navigation. It was difficult
to realize that this was the same stream on which I was
now sailing day after day in an opposite direction,—six days
in all, from Memphis to New Orleans. From St. Anthony’s
Falls to the Gulf, the Mississippi is navigable twenty-two hundred
miles. Its entire length is three thousand miles. Its
great tributary, the Missouri, is alone three thousand miles in
length: measured from its head-waters to the Gulf, it is four
thousand five hundred miles. Consider also the Ohio, the
Arkansas, the Red River, and the hundred lesser streams that
fall into it, and well may we call it by its Indian name, Michi-Sepe,
the Father of Waters.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LVI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CRESCENT CITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the morning of January 1st, 1866, I arrived at New
Orleans.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was midwinter; but the mild sunny weather that followed
the first chill days of rain, made me fancy it May. The gardens
of the city were verdant with tropical plants. White
roses in full bloom climbed upon trellises or the verandas of
houses. Oleander trees, bananas with their broad drooping
leaves six feet long, and Japan plums that ripen in February,
grew side by side in the open air. There were orange-trees
whose golden fruit could be picked from the balconies which
they half concealed. Magnolias, gray-oaks and live-oaks,
some heavily hung with moss that swung in the breeze like
waving hair, shaded the yards and streets. I found the roadsides
of the suburbs green with grass, and the vegetable gardens
checkered and striped with delicately contrasting rows of
lettuce, cabbages, carrots, beets, onions, and peas in blossom.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French quarter of the city impresses you as a foreign
town transplanted to the banks of the Mississippi. Many of
the houses are very ancient, with low, moss-covered roofs projecting
over the first story, like slouched hat-brims over quaint
old faces. The more modern houses are often very elegant,
and not less picturesque. The names of the streets are Pagan,
foreign, and strange. The gods and muses of mythology, the
saints of the Church, the Christian virtues, and modern heroes,
are all here. You have streets of “Good Children,” of “Piety,”
of “Apollo,” of “St. Paul,” of “Euterpe,” and all their relations.
The shop-signs are in French, or in French and English.
The people you meet have a foreign air and speak a foreign
tongue. Their complexions range through all hues, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>dark Creole to the ebon African. The anomalous third class
of Louisiana—the respectable free colored people of French-African
descent—are largely represented. Dressed in silks,
accompanied by their servants, and speaking good French,—for
many of them are well educated,—the ladies and children
of this class enter the street cars, which they enliven with the
Parisian vivacity of their conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mingling of foreign and American elements has given
to New Orleans a great variety of styles of architecture; and
the whole city has a light, picturesque, and agreeable appearance.
It is built upon an almost level strip of land bordering
upon the left bank of the river, and falling back from the levee
with an imperceptible slope to the cypress and alligator swamps
in the rear. The houses have no cellars. I noticed that the
surface drainage of the city flowed <em>back</em> from the river into
the Bayou St. John, a navigable inlet of Lake Ponchartrain.
The old city front lay upon a curve of the Mississippi, which
gave it a crescent shape: hence its poetic <em>soubriquet</em>. The
modern city has a river front seven miles in extent, bent like
the letter S.</p>

<p class='c000'>The broad levee, lined with wharves on one side and belted
by busy streets on the other, crowded with merchandise, and
thronged with merchants, boatmen, and laborers, presents always
a lively and entertaining spectacle. Steam and sailing
crafts of every description, arriving, departing, loading, unloading,
and fringing the city with their long array of smoke-pipes
and masts, give you some idea of the commerce of New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is the great cotton market of the world. In looking
over the cotton statistics of the past thirty years, I found that
nearly one half the crop of the United States had passed
through this port. In 1855–1856 (the mercantile cotton year
beginning September 1st and ending August 31st) 1,795,023
bales were shipped from New Orleans,—986,622 to Great
Britain (chiefly to Liverpool); 214,814 to France (chiefly to
Havre); 162,657 to the North of Europe; 178,812 to the
South of Europe, Mexico, &amp;c.; and 222,100 coastwise,—151,469
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>going to Boston and 51,340 to New York. In 1859–1860,
2,214,296 bales were exported, 1,426,966 to Great Britain,
313,291 to France, and 208,634 coastwise,—131,648
going to Boston, 62,936 to New York, and 5,717 to Providence.
This, it will be remembered, was the great cotton
year, the crop amounting to near 5,000,000 bales.</p>

<p class='c000'>One is interested to learn how much cotton left this port
during the war. In 1860–1861, 1,915,852 bales were shipped,
nearly all before hostilities began; in 1861–1862, 27,627 bales;
in 1862–1863, 23,750; in 1863–1864, 128,130; in 1864–1865,
192,351. The total receipts during this last year were
271,015 bales. From September 1st, 1865, to January 1st,
1866, the receipts were 375,000 bales; and cotton was still
coming. The warehouses on the lower tributaries of the Mississippi
were said to be full of it, waiting for high water to
send it down. There had been far more concealed in the
country than was supposed: it made its appearance where least
looked for; and such was the supply that experienced traders
believed that prices would thenceforth be steadily on the decline.</p>

<p class='c000'>A first-class Liverpool steamer is calculated to take out 3000
500-pound bales, the freight on which is 7–8ths of a penny
per pound,—not quite two cents. The freight to New York
and Boston is 1 1–4th cents by steamers, and 7–8ths of a cent
by sailing-vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>I put up at the St. Charles, famous before the war as a hotel,
and during the war as the head-quarters of General Butler.
It is a conspicuous edifice, with white-pillared porticos, and a
spacious Rotunda, thronged nightly with a crowd which strikes
a stranger with astonishment. It is a sort of social evening
exchange, where merchants, planters, travellers, river-men,
army men, (principally Rebels,) manufacturing and jobbing
agents, showmen, overseers, idlers, sharpers, gamblers, foreigners,
Yankees, Southern men, the well dressed and the prosperous,
the rough and the seedy, congregate together, some leaning
against the pillars, and a few sitting about the stoves, which
are almost hidden from sight by the concourse of people standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>or moving about in the great central space. Numbers of
citizens regularly spend their evenings here, as at a club-room.
One, an old plantation overseer of the better class, told me
that for years he had not missed going to the Rotunda a single
night, except when absent from the city. The character he
gave the crowd was not complimentary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are all trying to get money without earning it. Each
is doing his best to shave the rest. If they ever make anything,
I don’t know it. I’ve been here two thousand nights,
and never made a cent yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired what brought him here.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For company; to kill time. I never was married, and
never had a home. When I was young, the girls said I smelt
like a wet dog; that’s because I was poor. Since I’ve got
rich, I’m too old to get married.”</p>

<p class='c000'>What he was thinking of now was a fortune to be made out
of labor-saving machinery to be used on the plantations: “I
wish I could get hold of a half-crazy feller, to fix up a cotton
planter, cotton-picker, cane-cutter, and a thing to hill up
some.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He talked cynically of the planters. “They’re a helpless
set. They’re all confused. They don’t know what
they’re going to do. They never did know much else but to
get drunk. If a man has a plantation to rent or sell, he can’t
tell anything about it; you can’t get any proposition out of
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He complained that Northern capital lodged in the cotton
belt; but little of it getting through to the sugar country. He
did not know any lands let to Northern men. “They hav’n’t
got sugar on the brain; it’s cotton they’re all crazy after.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He used to oversee for fifteen hundred dollars a year: he
was now offered five thousand. He was a well-dressed, rather
intelligent, capable man; and I noticed that the planters treated
him with respect. But his manner toward them was cool and
independent: he could not forget old times. “I never was
thought anything of by these men, till I got rich. Then they
began to say ‘Dick P—— is a mighty clever feller;’ and by-and-by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>it got to be ‘Mr. P——.’ Now they all come to me,
because I know about business, and they don’t know a thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Like everybody else, he had much to say of the niggers.
“A heap of the planters wants ’em all killed off. But I believe
in the nigger. He’ll work, if they’ll only let him alone.
They fool him, and tell him such lies, he’s no confidence.
I’ve worked free niggers and white men, and always found the
niggers worked the best. But no nigger, nor anybody else,
will work like a slave works with the whip behind him. You
can’t make ’em. I was brought up to work alongside o’ niggers,
and soon as I got out of it, nothing, no money, could
induce me to work so again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of other overseers, he said: “I admit I was about
as tight on the nigger as a man ought to be. If I’d been a
slave, I shouldn’t have wanted to work under a master that
was tighter than I was. But I wa’n’t a priming to some.
You see that red-faced feller with his right hand behind him,
talking with two men? He’s an overseer. I know of his
killing two niggers, and torturing another so that he died in a
few days.” (I omit the shocking details of the punishment
said to have been applied.) “The other night he came here
to kill me because I told about him. He pulled out his pistol,
and says he, ‘Dick P——, did you tell so-and-so I killed
three niggers on Clark’s plantation?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, ‘I said
so, and can prove it; and if there’s any shooting to be done,
I can shoot as fast as you can.’ After that he bullied around
here some, then went off, and I hav’n’t heard anything about
shooting since.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earliest acquaintances I made at New Orleans
was General Phil. Sheridan, perhaps the most brilliant and
popular fighting man of the war. I found him in command
of the Military Division of the Gulf, comprising the States of
Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. In Florida he had at that time
seven thousand troops; in Louisiana, nine thousand; and in
Texas, twenty thousand, embracing ten thousand colored
troops at Corpus Christi and on the Rio Grande, watching
the French movements.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>It was Sheridan’s opinion that the Rebellion would never
be ended until Maximilian was driven from Mexico. Such a
government on our borders cherished the seeds of ambition
and discontent in the minds of the late Confederates. Many
were emigrating to Mexico, and there was danger of their
uniting either with the Liberals or the Imperialists, and forming
a government inimical to the United States. To prevent
such a possibility, he had used military and diplomatic strategy.
Three thousand Rebels having collected in Monterey,
he induced the Liberals to arrest and disarm them. Then in
order that they should not be received by the Imperialists,
he made hostile demonstrations, sending a pontoon train to
Brownsville, and six thousand cavalry to San Antonio, establishing
military posts, and making extensive inquiries for
forage. Under such circumstances, Maximilian did not feel
inclined to welcome the Rebel refugees. It is even probable
that, had our government at that time required the withdrawal
of the French from Mexico, the demand, emphasized
by these and similar demonstrations, would have been complied
with. Maximilian is very weak in his position. Nineteen
twentieths of the people are opposed to him. There is
no regular, legitimate taxation for the support of his government,
but he levies contributions upon merchants for a small
part of the funds he requires, and draws upon France for the
rest. His “government” consists merely of an armed occupation
of the country; with long lines of communication between
military posts, which could be easily cut off and captured
one after another by a comparatively small force.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Southern country, in the General’s opinion, was fast
becoming “Northernized.” It was very poor, and going to
be poorer. The planters had no enterprise, no recuperative
energy: they were entirely dependent upon Northern capital
and Northern spirit. He thought the freedmen’s affairs required
no legislation, but that the State should leave them to
be regulated by the natural law of supply and demand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Phil. Sheridan is a man of small stature, compactly and
somewhat massively built, with great toughness of constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>fibre, and an alert countenance, expressive of remarkable
energy and force. I inquired if he experienced no reaction
after the long strain upon his mental and bodily powers occasioned
by the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only a pleasant one,” he replied. “During my Western
campaigns, when I was continually in the saddle, I weighed
but a hundred and fifteen pounds. My flesh was hard as iron.
Now my weight is a hundred and forty-five.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went over with me to the City Hall, to which the
Executive department of the State had been removed, and
introduced me to Governor Wells, a plain, elderly man, affable,
and loyal in his speech. I remember his saying that the
action of the President, in pardoning Governor Humphreys,
of Mississippi, after he had been elected by the people on
account of his services in the Confederate cause, was doing
great harm throughout the South, encouraging Rebels and
discouraging Union men. “Everything is being conceded to
traitors,” said he, “before they have been made to feel the
Federal power.” He spoke of the strong Rebel element in
the Legislature which he was combating; and gave me copies
of two veto messages which he had returned to it with bills
that were passed for the especial benefit of traitors. The new
serf code, similar to that of Mississippi, engineered through
the Legislature by a member of the late Confederate Congress,
he had also disapproved. After this, I was surprised to hear
from other sources how faithfully he had been carrying out
the very policy which he professed to condemn,—even going
beyond the President, in removing from office Union men appointed
by Governor Hahn and appointing Secessionists and
Rebels in their place; and advocating the Southern doctrine
that the Government must pay for the slaves it had
emancipated. Such discrepancies between deeds and professions
require no comment. Governor Wells is not the
only one, nor the highest, among public officers, who, wishing
to reconcile the irreconcilable, and to stand well before the
country whilst they were strengthening the hands and gaining
the favor of its enemies, have suffered their loyal protestations
to be put to some confusion by acts of doubtful patriotism.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>At the Governor’s room I had the good fortune to meet the
Mayor of the city, Mr. Hugh Kennedy, whom I afterwards
called upon by appointment. By birth a Scotchman, he had
been thirty years a citizen of New Orleans, and, from the
beginning of the Secession troubles, had shown himself a
stanch patriot. He was appointed to the mayoralty by President
Lincoln; General Banks removed him, but he was afterwards
reinstated.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found him an almost enthusiastic believer in the future
greatness of New Orleans. “It is certain,” he said, “to
double its population in ten years. Its prosperity dates from
the day of the abolition of slavery. Men who formerly lived
upon the proceeds of slave-labor are now stimulated to enterprise.
A dozen industrial occupations will spring up where
there was one before. Manufactures are already taking a
start. We have two new cotton-mills just gone into operation.
The effect upon the whole country will be similar.
Formerly planters went or sent to New York and Boston and
laid in their supplies; for this reason there were no villages in
the South. But now that men work for wages, which they
will wish to spend near home, villages will everywhere spring
up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Living, in New Orleans, he said, was very cheap. The
fertile soil produces, with little labor, an abundance of vegetables
the year round. Cattle are brought from the extensive
prairies of the State, and from the vast pastures of Texas:
and contractors had engaged to supply the charitable institutions
of the city with the rumps and rounds of beef at six
cents a pound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The street railroads promised to yield a considerable revenue
to the city. The original company paid only $130,000
for the privilege of laying down its rails, and an exclusive
right to the track for twenty-five years. But two new roads
had been started, one of which had stipulated to pay to the
city government eleven and a half per cent. of its gross proceeds,
and the other twenty-two and a half per cent. “In
two or three years an annual income from that source will not
be less than $200,000.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>From Mr. Kennedy I learned that free people of color
owned property in New Orleans to the amount of $15,000,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was delighted with the working of the free-labor system.
“I thought it an indication of progress when the white laborers
and negroes on the levees the other day made a strike for
higher wages. They were receiving two dollars and a half and
three dollars a day, and they struck for five and seven dollars.
They marched up the levee in a long procession, white and
black together. I gave orders that they should not be interfered
with as long as they interfered with nobody else; but
when they undertook by force to prevent other laborers from
working, the police promptly put a stop to their proceedings.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LVII.<br /> <span class='large'>POLITICS, FREE LABOR, AND SUGAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Through the courtesy of the Mayor I became acquainted
with some of the radical Union men of New Orleans. Like
the same class in Richmond and elsewhere, I found them extremely
dissatisfied with the political situation and prospects.
“Everything,” they said, “has been given up to traitors.
The President is trying to help the nation out of its difficulty
by restoring to power the very men who created the difficulty.
To have been a good Rebel is now in a man’s favor; and to
have stood by the government through all its trials is against
him. If an original secessionist, or a time-serving, half-and-half
Union man, ready to make any concession for the convenience
of the moment, goes to Washington, he gets the ear of
the administration, and comes away full of encouragement for
the worst enemies the government ever had. If a man of
principle goes to Washington, he gets nothing but plausible
words which amount to nothing, if he isn’t actually insulted
for his trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I heard everywhere the same complaints from this class.
And here I may state that they were among the saddest
things I had to endure in the South. Whatever may be
thought of the intrinsic merits of any measures, we cannot
but feel misgivings when we see our late enemies made jubilant
by them, and loyal men dismayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Union men of New Orleans were severe in their strictures
on General Banks. “It was he,” they said, “who precipitated
the organization of the State government on a Rebel
basis. Read his <cite>General Orders No. 35</cite>, issued March 11th,
1864, concerning the election of delegates to the Convention.
Rebels who have taken the amnesty oath are admitted to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>polls, and loyal colored men are excluded. Section 4th reads,
‘Every free white man,’ &amp;c. Since his return to Massachusetts
he has been making speeches in favor of negro suffrage.
He is in favor of it there, where it is popular as an abstraction,
and a man gets into Congress on the strength of it; but
he was not in favor of it here, where there was a chance of
making it practical. His excuse was, that if black men voted
white men would take offence, and keep away from the polls.
Very likely some white men would, but loyal white men
wouldn’t. That he had the power to extend the franchise to
the blacks, or at least thought he had, may be seen by his
apology for not doing so, in which he says: ‘I did not decide
upon this subject without very long and serious consideration,’
and so forth. So he let the great, the golden opportunity
slip, of organizing the State government on a loyal basis,—of
demonstrating the capacity of the colored man for self-government,
and, of setting an example to the other Rebel States.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Being one day in the office of Mr. Durant, a prominent
lawyer and Union man, I was much struck by the language
and bearing of a gentleman who called upon him, and carried
on a long conversation in French. Having understood that
the Creoles were nearly all secessionists, I was surprised to
hear this man give utterance to the most enlightened Republican
sentiments. After he had gone out, I expressed my
gratification at having met him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That,” said Mr. Durant, “is one of the ablest and wealthiest
business men in New Orleans. He was educated in Paris.
But there is one thing about him you do not seem to have suspected.
He belongs to that class of Union men the government
has made up its mind to leave politically bound in the
hands of the Rebels. That man, whom you thought refined
and intelligent, has not the right which the most ignorant,
Yankee-hating, negro-hating Confederate soldier has. He is
a colored man, and has no vote.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were six daily newspapers published in New Orleans,—five
in English and one in English and French,—besides
several weeklies. There was but one loyal sheet among them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>and that was a “nigger paper,” the <cite>Tribune</cite>, not sold by any
newsboy, and, I believe, by but one news-dealer.</p>

<p class='c000'>I called on General T. W. Sherman, in command of the
Eastern District of Louisiana, who told me that, in order to
please the people, our troops had been withdrawn from the
interior, and that the militia, consisting mostly of Rebel soldiers,
many of whom still wore the Rebel uniform, had been
organized to fill their place. The negroes, whom they treated
tyrannically, had been made to believe that it was the United
States, and not the State government, that had thus set their
enemies to keep guard over them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both Governor Wells and General Sherman had received
piles of letters from “prominent parties” expressing fears of
negro insurrections. The most serious indications of bloody
retribution preparing for the white race had been reported in
the Teche country, where regiments of black cavalry were
said to be organized and drilled. The General, on visiting the
spot, and investigating the truth of the story, learned that it
had its foundation in the fact that some negro boys had been
playing soldier with wooden swords. No wonder the Rebel
militia was thought necessary!</p>

<p class='c000'>From General Baird, Assistant-Commissioner, and General
Gregg, Inspecting-Agent of the Freedmen’s Bureau, I obtained
official information regarding the condition of free labor
in Louisiana. A detailed account of it would be but a recapitulation,
with slight variations, of what I have said of free labor
in other States. The whites were as ignorant of the true
nature of the system as the blacks. Capitalists did not understand
how they could secure labor without owning it, or how
men could be induced to work without the whip. It was thought
necessary to make a serf of him who was no longer a slave.
To this end the Legislature had passed a code of black laws
even more objectionable than that enacted by the Legislature
of Mississippi. By its provisions freedmen were to be arrested
as vagrants who had not, on the 10th of January, 1866, entered
into contracts for the year. They were thus left little
choice as to employers, and none as to terms. They were also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>subjected to a harsh system of fines and punishments for loss
of time and the infraction of contracts; and made responsible
for all losses of stock on the plantation, until they should be
able to prove that they had not killed it. Although these laws
had not been approved by the Governor, there was no doubt
but they would be approved and enforced as soon as the national
troops were removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A majority of the Southern planters clamored for the withdrawal
of the troops and the Freedmen’s Bureau. But Northern
planters settled in the State as earnestly opposed the
measure. “If the government’s protection goes, we must go
too. It would be impossible for us to live here without it.
Planters would come to us and say, ‘Here, you’ve got a nigger
that belongs to us;’ they would claim him, under the State
laws, and compel him to go and work for them. Not a first-class
laborer could we be sure of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, as elsewhere, the fact that the freedmen had no independent
homes, but lived in negro-quarters at the will of the
owner, placed him under great disadvantages, which the presence
of the Bureau was necessary to counteract. The planters
desired nothing so much as to be left to manage the negroes
with or without the help of State laws. “With that privilege,”
they said, “we can make more out of them than ever. The
government must take care of the old and worthless niggers it
has set free, and we will put through the able-bodied ones.”
The disposition to keep the freedmen in debt by furnishing
their supplies at dishonest prices, and to impose upon their
helplessness and ignorance in various other ways, was very
general.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately there was a great demand for labor, and the
freedmen, with the aid of the Bureau, were making favorable
contracts with their employers. When encouraged by just treatment
and fair wages, they were working well. But they were
observed to be always happier, thriftier, and more comfortable,
living in little homes of their own and working land on their
own account, than in any other condition. “I believe,” said
General Gregg, “the best thing philanthropic Northern capitalists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>can do both for the freedmen and for themselves, is to
buy up tracts of land, which can be had in some of the most
fertile sections of Louisiana at two, three, and five dollars an
acre, to be leased to the freedmen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The more enlightened planters were in favor of educating
the blacks. But the majority were opposed to it; so that in
many parishes it was impossible to establish schools, while in
others it had been very difficult. In January last there were
278 teachers in the State, instructing 19,000 pupils in 143
schools. The expenses, $20,000 a month, were defrayed by
the Bureau from the proceeds of rents of abandoned and confiscated
estates. But this source of revenue had nearly failed,
in consequence of the indiscriminate pardoning of Rebel owners
and the restoration of their property. In New Orleans,
for example, the rents of Rebel estates had dwindled, in October,
1865, to $8,000; in December, to $1,500; and they were
still rapidly diminishing. The result was, it had been necessary
to order the discontinuance of all the schools in the State
at the end of January, the funds in the treasury of the Bureau
being barely sufficient to hold out until that time. It was
hoped, however, that they would soon be reëstablished on a
permanent basis, by a tax upon the freedmen themselves. For
this purpose, the Assistant Commissioner had ordered that five
per cent. of their wages should be paid by their employers to
the agents of the Bureau. The freedmen’s schools in New
Orleans were not in session at the time I was there; but I
heard them highly praised by those who had visited them.
Here is Mr. Superintendent Warren’s account of them:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the infant which must learn to count its fingers, to the
scholar who can read and understand blank-verse, we have grades
and departments adapted and free to all. Examinations, promotions,
and gradations are had at stated seasons. The city is divided into
districts; each district has its school, and each school the several departments
of primary, intermediate, and grammar. A principal is
appointed to each school, with the requisite number of assistants.
Our teachers are mostly from the North, with a few Southerners,
who have heroically dared the storm of prejudice to do good and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>right. The normal method of teaching is adopted, and object teaching
is a specialty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are eight schools in the city, with from two to eight hundred
pupils each, which, with those in the suburbs, amount to sixteen
schools with nearly six thousand pupils and one hundred teachers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was estimated that there were at least fifty thousand
Northern men in Louisiana. Some were in the lumber business,
which had been stimulated to great activity throughout
the South. Many were working cotton plantations with
every prospect of success; a few had purchased, others were
paying a fixed rent, while some were furnishing capital to be
refunded by the crop, of which they were to have a third or a
half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Occasionally I heard of one who had taken a sugar plantation.
Mr. ——, a merchant of New York, told me he had for
two years been working the Buena Vista plantation, in St.
James Parish. He employed an agent, and visited the place
himself once a year. There were twelve hundred acres under
cultivation, for which he paid an annual rent of sixteen thousand
dollars. There was one hundred thousand dollars’ worth
of machinery on the plantation. He employed sixty freedmen.
They worked faithfully and well, but needed careful management.
During the past year but one had deserted, while two
had been discharged. They received one third of their wages
monthly, and the remainder at the end of the year. “If they
were paid in full as fast as their work was done, when sugar-making
season comes they would be apt to quit, the labor is so
hard,—though we pay them then fifty cents a night extra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired concerning profits. “The first year we lost
money. This year we have made it up, and more. Next
year we shall be in full blast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It takes three years from the start to get a sugar plantation
going; and in two years, if neglected, the cane will run out.
This is the case in Louisiana,—although I was told that in
the West Indies some kinds of cane would yield twenty or
thirty successive crops, without replanting. In some parts of
the State, where the soil is too dry, or the climate too cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>for the most profitable cultivation, it requires replanting every
year for the subsequent year’s crop.</p>

<p class='c000'>The majority of the plantations in Lower Louisiana, said to
be good for little else but sugar and sweet potatoes, were waste
and unavailable. St. Mary’s Parish had been almost entirely
abandoned. The cane had run out; seed-cane was not to be
had; and to recommence the culture an outlay of capital was
necessary, from which no such immediate, bountiful returns
could be anticipated as from the culture of cotton.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sugar region and the cotton belt overlap each other.
Cane may be cultivated to some extent as far north as 34°,
while cotton ranges as far south as 30°, although it can scarcely
be considered a safe or profitable crop much below 31°. In 1850
there were in Louisiana 4205 cotton and 1558 sugar plantations.
This year cotton is not only king, but a usurper, holding
with uncertain tenure much of the special province of sugar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Good cotton plantations in Louisiana yield a bale (of five
hundred pounds) to the acre. The sugar crop varies from
five hundred to thirty-five hundred pounds, according to the
fitness of the soil, the length of the season, and the mode of
culture. A hogshead of eleven hundred and fifty pounds to
the acre, is about an average crop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Five different varieties of cane are used by the planters of
Louisiana. The cuttings from which it is propagated are called
“seed-cane.” They are cut in September, and laid in “mats,”—a
sort of stack adapted to protect them from frost. Cane
is usually planted between the months of October and March.
Two or three stalks are laid together in prepared rows
seven feet apart, and covered by five or six inches of soil.
This is called the “mother-cane.” In cold soil it rots, and is
eaten by vermin. The first year’s growth is called “plant-cane,”
and is ploughed and hoed like corn. On being cut,
new stalks spring up from the roots. These subsequent year’s
stalks are called rattoons,—a West Indian word, derived from
the Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">retonó</span></i>, (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">retoñar</span></i>, to sprout again,) which was probably
imported into Louisiana, together with the Creole cane,
by the refugees from St. Domingo, in 1794.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>“There’s nothing handsomer,” said my friend Dick P——,
the overseer, “than a field of cane on the first of June, high
as your head, all green, a thousand acres, waving and shining
in the wind.” It is a lively scene when a gang of fifty or sixty
negroes, armed with knives, enter such a field in the fall, and
the cutting begins.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was desirous of seeing a sugar-mill in operation, but could
hear of none within convenient visiting distance. The scene
is thus described in a letter written by a Northern lady whose
husband was last year working a Louisiana plantation:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sitting in the gallery of a building two hundred and fifty
feet long. This gallery was made expressly for the white overseer,
and overlooks all that is going on in the main building. There is a
sleeping-room in each end of it, and a large open space in the middle
which serves as a dining-room; here I am writing. In the opposite
end of the building I can see the engine which carries all the machinery;
just this side of it are the great rollers that crush the cane,
and the apron, or feed-carrier, that carries the cane from the shed
outside up to the crushers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just this side of the crushers are four large vats that receive the
juice. From these it is carried into two large kettles, where the
lime is put in, and the juice is raised to the boiling-point, and then
skimmed. From these kettles the juice is transferred by means of a
bucket attached to a long pole, to the next kettle, where it is worked
to the right consistency for clarifying.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This done, it is conveyed, by means of a steam-pump, to the filtering
room, where it is passed into large vats filled with burnt bones,
called bone black, through which it is filtered, and thus freed from all
impurities. From these filters it is run off into a large cistern, and
pumped up by the same steam-pump into tanks, where, by means of
faucets, it is drawn into the sugaring-off pan. In this pan it is heated
by means of a coil of pipe that winds round and round till it fills the
bottom of the pans and carries the steam which, in from fifteen to
twenty minutes, finishes the boiling process. From this pan it is let
off into a box car, set on a railroad track which runs up and down
between the coolers, which are ranged along each side of this end of
the building, like pews in a church.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Creoles along the coast have looked with amazement all summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>upon our success with free black laborers, and have been obliged
to acknowledge that they never saw a more cheerful, industrious set
of laborers in all their experience. ‘But wait till sugar-making
comes,’ they have said, ‘and then see if you can get off your crop
without the old system of compulsion. Your niggers will flare up
when you get off your ten-hour system. They are not going to work
night and day, and you cannot get off the crop unless they do.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“White sugar-makers presented themselves, telling us, in all sobriety,
‘Niggers cannot be trusted to make sugar,’ and offering, with
great magnanimity, to oversee the matter for five hundred dollars.
J—— declined all such friendly offers, and last Monday morning
commenced grinding cane. The colored men and women went to work
with a will,—no shirking or flinching. The cutters pushed the
handlers, the handlers pushed the haulers, and so on, night and day,
each gang taking their respective watches, and all moving on with
the regularity of clock-work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And so the business went on with black engineers, black crushers,
black filterers, black sugar-makers,—all black throughout,—but
the sugar came out splendid in quantity and quality. Sixty
hogsheads of sugar, finished by Saturday night, and things in readiness
for the Sabbath’s rest, is acknowledged by old planters to be the
largest run ever made in this sugar-house for the first week of the
sugar season. So they gape and stare, and wonder that humanity
and justice can bring forth more profitable results than the driver’s
whip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Louisiana has been the great sugar-growing State of the
Union. For several years before the war, the annual crop
varied from 100,000 to 450,000 hogsheads. In 1864 less than
nine thousand hogsheads were produced. In 1865 the crop
amounted to between sixteen and seventeen thousand hogsheads,
less than was raised in 1860 on four plantations!</p>

<p class='c000'>Attempts were being made to introduce white laborers into
Louisiana. While I was there, one hundred Germans, who
had been hired in New York for a sugar plantation, were
landed in New Orleans. Within twenty-four hours thirty of
them deserted for higher wages; by which trifling circumstance
planters, who had hoped to exchange black for white
labor, were very much disgusted.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE OF MOBILE BAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Leaving New Orleans for Mobile at half-past four o’clock,
by the usual route, I reached Lake Ponchartrain by railroad
in time to take the steamer and be off at sunset.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lake, with its low, dark-wooded shores, and its placid,
glassy waters, unruffled by a breeze, outspread under the evening
sky, was a scene of solitary and tranquil beauty. Here
its breast was burnished with the splendors of a reflected
cloud, which faded, leaving upon the darkening rim of the
lake the most delicate belts of green, and blue, and violet,
until these faded in their turn, and the gloomy surface appeared
sprinkled all over with molten stars. Strange constellations
rose in the Southern hemisphere; while others about
the opposite pole, which never set in the latitude of the Northern
States, were below the horizon. The “Dipper” was
dipped in the lake. I had never seen the North Star so low
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>I walked the deck with the mate, who had been a good
Rebel, and was concerned in the capture of the United States
steamer “Water Witch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had command of one of the boats,” said he. “There
was a consultation of officers, and it was proposed to make the
attack that night at eleven o’clock; we would have the tide
with us then. ‘For that very reason,’ I said, ‘I would postpone
it until two. Then we shall have the tide against us.
It will be harder pulling down to her, but we can board better,
and if we miss grappling the first time we shan’t drift by and
get fired upon; and if we fail, we can come back on the tide.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The steamer was surprised, and the boarding was a success.
“The officer in command of our party was killed, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>command devolved upon me. I got three wounds, one through
this arm, one across my stomach, and one through the fleshy
part of my thigh. But I laid out a man for each wound. I
got to the cabin, and had my sword at the captain’s throat,
and would have run him through, if he hadn’t been mighty
glib in his speech: ‘I surrender! I surrender!’ He didn’t
stammer a bit! ‘Do you surrender your command?’ ‘Yes,
yes! I do!’ And in a minute I stopped the fighting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the style of story one hears travelling anywhere in
the South. Lying in my berth in the cabin, I was kept awake
half the night by Rebel soldiers relating similar adventures.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_416.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The next morning we were in the Gulf of Mexico. We
had entered by the South Pass, the tide being unfavorable for
an inside passage between the islands and the coast. It was a
summer-like, beautiful day. Gulls and pelicans were sailing
around and over the steamer and sporting on the waves. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>the south was the open Gulf; on our left, a series of low, barren,
sandy islands,—Ship Island among them, reminding one
of Butler’s Expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the morning we sailed the lustrous, silken waters of the
Gulf; approaching in the afternoon the entrance to Mobile
Bay. Porpoises were tumbling, and pelicans diving, all around
us. Flocks of gulls followed, picking up the fragments of our
dinner thrown overboard by the cook. Sometimes a hundred
would be fighting in the air for a morsel one of them had
picked up,—chasing the bird that bore it, snatching it, dropping
it, and darting to catch it as it fell,—until left far behind,
and almost lost to sight on the horizon; then they would come
up again, flapping low along our white wake, until another
fragment attracted and detained them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed the curious, well-defined line, where the yellowish
river-water from the Bay and the pure liquid crystal of the
Gulf met and mingled. On our left, the long, smooth swells
burst into white breakers on the shoals below Pelican Island.
On the point of Dauphin Island beyond was Fort Gaines,
while close upon our right, as we passed up, was Fort Morgan,
on a point of the main land,—its brick walls built upon
a sheet of sand white as snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having kept the outside passage, instead of the usual route of
the New Orleans steamers, our course lay between these forts,
up the main ship-channel, past the scene of Farragut’s famous
fight. I thought of Brownell’s ringing lyric of that day:—</p>

but wholly unique and modern.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LIX.<br /> <span class='large'>MOBILE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Above the forts the merchant fleet lies at anchor, twenty-five
miles from Mobile,—the shallowness of the bay preventing
at all times vessels drawing more than ten feet of water
from going up to the city. The extensive gulf coast of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama, presents not a single first-class
harbor. The first you meet with is that of Pensacola.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steamers were plying between the ships and the city, receiving
and delivering cargoes. We met or passed them as
we kept on our course. Blueish lines of forests enclosed the
Bay. Four miles below the city we came in sight of the Rebel
defences. On our right were the bastion and extensive fortifications
of Spanish Fort, commanding Minetta Bay and several
miles of the coast of Mobile Bay. This work, originally
built by De Soto more than three centuries ago, was finally
invested by our fleet and land forces on the day of the fall of
Richmond. It surrendered on the ninth of April, and on the
eleventh Mobile was evacuated. The water approaches to
this fort, and to the other defences of the city, were strewn
with torpedoes, by which four or five vessels of our fleet were
blown up.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed a line of obstructions, consisting of piles and
sunken wrecks thrown across the channel; and Mobile, a
smoking, sunlit city, lay before us on the low shore. By the
direct channel it was less than three miles distant; but, in
order to reach it, we were compelled to ascend Spanish River
to the Mobile River, and descend that stream, a circuit of over
twenty miles. It was four o’clock when we reached the wharf.</p>

<div class='ic006'>
<p>EXPLOSION AT MOBILE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Mobile is a level, shady town, regularly laid out, and
built on a dry, sandy plain. It is the principal city of Alabama,
and the second city in importance in the Gulf States;
its commerce ranking next to that of New Orleans. For several
years before the war its annual exports of cotton were
between six and seven hundred thousand bales. It endured a
four years’ blockade, falling into Federal hands only at the
latter end of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>But its great catastrophe did not occur until some time after
the termination of hostilities. It would seem as if the genius
of Destruction was determined to strike a final blow at the
city. The explosion of the lately captured Confederate ammunition
was one of the most terrible disasters of the kind ever
known. It was stored in a large three-story warehouse one
street back from the river. The last of Dick Taylor’s shells
were going in, when, it is supposed, one of them accidentally
ignited. Twenty brick blocks, and portions of other blocks,
were instantly blown to atoms. Four or five hundred persons
were killed,—it was never known how many. A black volcanic
cloud of smoke and fragments went up into the sky:
“It was big as a mountain,” said one. It was succeeded by
a fearful conflagration sweeping over the field of ruins. Ten
thousand bales of cotton were burned. The loss of property
was so immense that nobody ventured to estimate it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the vicinity of the explosion, citizens were thrown off
their feet, chimneys knocked down, and windows and doors
demolished. Lights of glass were broken all over the city, a
mile or more from the scene of the explosion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was lifted from the ground, and my hat thrown off,”
said one. “Then I looked up, and there were great black
blocks of something in the air, high as I could see, and shells
exploding.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Said another: “I was riding out a mile and a half from
the city. I heard a sound, and at the same time my head and
shoulders were thrown forward on my horse’s neck, as if I had
dodged. ‘That’s the first time I’ve dodged a cannon,’ I said,
‘and that’s after the war is over.’ I looked around, and saw
the strangest cloud going up slowly over the city. Then I
knew it was the shock that had thrown me down.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>The town had neither the means nor the material to rebuild:
“We made no bricks during the war.” I found the
scene of the disaster a vast field of ruins. Where had stood
the warehouse in which the ammunition was stored, there
was a pit twenty feet deep, half filled with water, and surrounded
by fragments of iron and bricks, and unexploded
shells. A large brick block, containing a cotton-press, which
stood between the magazine and the river, had entirely disappeared.
“The bricks were all blown into the water, and we
never saw them any more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Business was brisk. “There are more goods on Dauphin
Street to-day,” an old merchant told me, “than I have ever
before seen in the whole of Mobile.” And the captain of the
Mobile steamer, who took me up the Alabama to Selma, said:
“There was never such a trade on this river before. Nobody
ever expected such a freight on this boat: her guards are all
under water.” Her upward-bound lading consisted mostly of
supplies for plantations and provincial stores,—barrels of
Western flour and whiskey that had come down the Mississippi,
and boxes of fine liquors, soap, starch, and case goods,
from the North Atlantic ports. Her downward freight was
chiefly cotton.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LX.<br /> <span class='large'>ALABAMA PLANTERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Alabama River steamers resemble those of the Mississippi,
although inferior in size and style. But one meets a
very different class of passengers on board of them. The
Alabamians are a plain, rough set of men, not so fast as the
Mississippi-Valley planters, but more sober, more solid, more
loyal. They like their glass of grog, however, and some of
them are very sincere in their hatred of the government. I
found the most contradictory characters among them, which
I cannot better illustrate than by giving some specimens of
their conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is one of the despairing class. “The country is
ruined; not only the Southern country, but the Northern
country too. The prosperity of our people passed away with
the institution of slavery. I shall never try to make another
fortune. I made one, and lost it in a minute. I had a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars in niggers. I am now sixty
years old. I’ll bet a suit of clothes against a dime, there’ll
be no cotton crop raised this year. If there’s a crop grown,
the hands that raise it won’t pick it. Some few niggers go
on, and do well, just as before; but they’re mighty scarce.
They never will be as well off again as they have been, and
some of ’em see it. A nigger drayman came to me the other
day and asked me to buy him. He said, ‘I want a master.
When I had a master, I had nothing to do but to eat and
drink and sleep, besides my work. Now I have to work and
think too.’ When I said the law wouldn’t allow me to buy
him, he looked very much discouraged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I heard of a few such cases as this drayman’s, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>were far less common than one would have expected. Poor
fellow, he did not know that if he was ever to be anything
but an animal, a beast of burden, it was necessary for him to
begin to think.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. J——, of Marengo County, also an old man, talked in
a different spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The trouble with the freedmen is, they have not yet
learned that living is expensive. They never before had any
idea where their clothes came from, except that ‘Master gave
’em to me.’ In my county, I find them generally better disposed
than the whites. I don’t know of a case where they
have been treated kindly and justly, and have deserted their
masters. A few restless ones are exceptions. I noticed one
of my boys that I had asked to make a contract for the coming
year, packing up his things; and I said to him, ‘Warren, what
are you doing?’ He replied, ‘Master, they say if we make
contracts now, we’ll be branded, and made slaves again.’ I
had always treated him well. I don’t remember that I ever
struck him, but he says I did strike him once, and he’s a
truthful boy. Another old man that I was raised with, said,
‘Master, all the contract I want with you is that you shall
bury me, or I’ll bury you.’ He said he would go on and
work for me like he always had; and he’ll do it, for he’s an
honest man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. J—— related the case of one of his neighbors who
contracted with his freedmen to furnish their supplies and give
them one fifth of the crop. He gave them provisions for a
year at the start; and deducted a dollar a day for lost time.
“He raised the largest crop of corn he ever did; but when he
came to harvest it, he owed them nothing, though he had kept
his contract. He was honest, but he had managed badly. I
give my hands a share of the crop,” added Mr. J——. “But
I do not give them provisions any faster than they need them,
for if I did they would call in their friends, make a great
feast, and eat up everything,—they are so generous and improvident.
I deduct a dollar a day for lost time, but instead
of putting it into my own pocket, I give the lazy man’s dollar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>to those who do the lazy man’s work. I find that encourages
them, and the consequence is, there are few lost days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This genial old gentleman, whom I found to be well known
and highly esteemed throughout the country, justified the
North in its course during the war, and expressed confidence
in the future of the South under the free-labor system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. G——, one of the bitterest Yankee-haters I met, became
nevertheless one of my most intimate steamboat acquaintances.
I cull the following from many talks I had with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I owned a cotton factory in Dallas County, above Selma.
I had two plantations besides, and an interest in a tan-yard.
Wilson’s Thieves came in, and just stripped me of everything.
They burned eight hundred bales of cotton for me. That was
because I happened to be running my mill for the Confederate
government. I was making Osnaburgs for the government
for a dollar a yard, when citizens would have paid me four
dollars a yard; and do you imagine I’d have done that except
under compulsion? But the Yankee rascals didn’t stop
to consider that fact. They skipped my neighbors’ cotton and
burned mine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In other respects they treated them as bad as they did me.
They robbed our houses of everything they could find and
carry away. I shouldn’t have had a thing left, if it hadn’t
been for my niggers. Some of ’em run off my mules and
saved ’em. I gave all my gold and silver to an old woman
who kept it hid from the raiders. On one of my plantations
a colored carpenter and his wife barrelled up three barrels of
fine table crockery and buried it. One of the Yankee officers
rode up and said to this woman, ‘Where’s your husband?’
‘There’s my husband,’ she said, pointing to the mulatto.
‘You’re a sight whiter’n he is,’ he said,—for she is white as
anybody, and he had taken her for the lady of the house. An
old negro saved the tannery by pleading with the vandals,
and lying to ’em a little bit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in gold wouldn’t
cover my losses. I never can feel towards this government
like I once did. I got started to leave the country; I swore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>I wouldn’t live under a government that had treated me in
this way. I made up my mind to go to Brazil. I got as far
as Mobile, and changed my mind. Now I’ve concluded to
remain here, like any alien. I’m a foreigner. I scorn to be
called a citizen of the United States. I shall take no oath, so
help me God! Unless,” he added immediately, “it is to
enable me to vote. I want to vote to give the suffrage to the
negro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I expressed my surprise at this extraordinary wish, he
went on: “Because I think that will finish the job. I think
then we’ll have enough of the nigger, North and South, and
all will combine to put him out of the country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me,” I said, “you are a little ungrateful after
all you say your negroes have done for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are a few faithful ones among them,” he replied.
“If all were like some of mine I wouldn’t say anything.
They’re as intelligent and well behaved as anybody. But I
can’t stand free niggers, any how!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I notice,” said I, “that every man who curses the black
race, and prays for its removal or extermination, makes exceptions
in favor of negroes he has raised or owned, until I am
beginning to think these exceptions compose a majority of the
colored population.”</p>

<p class='c000'>G—— made no reply to the remark, but resumed,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want this country filled up with white men. I want the
large plantations cut up, and manufactories established. We
never had any manufactories for this reason: Southern capitalists
all jammed their money into niggers and land. As
their capital increased, it was a few more niggers, a little more
land. The few factories we had were consequently one-horse
concerns, that couldn’t compete with those at the North.
They were patronized by men who wanted to buy on credit.
If a man had cash, he went to the North to buy goods; if
he was short, he bought here. Consequently, to carry on a
business of a hundred thousand dollars, a capital of three hundred
thousand dollars was necessary. Two thirds of it was
sunk; below the water, like the guards of this boat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>“Now I want the old system played out. But,” continued
G——, “if the Freedmen’s Bureau is withdrawn, things will
work back again into their old grooves. The nigger is going
to be made a serf, sure as you live. It won’t need any law
for that. Planters will have an understanding among themselves:
‘You won’t hire my niggers, and I won’t hire yours;’
then what’s left for them? They’re attached to the soil,
and we’re as much their masters as ever. I’ll stake my life,
this is the way it will work. The country will be no better
off than it ever was. To make a farming and manufacturing
country, like you have at the North, we must put the nigger
out of the way. For this reason, I hope the cotton crop this
year will be a failure. And I not only hope, but I know it
will. There a’n’t labor enough in the country; the planters
are going to bid against each other, and make contracts they
won’t be able to keep, and that’s going to put the Old Harry
into the freedmen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I remarked that, as long as the demand for labor exceeded
the supply, planters would continue to bid against each other,
and that the plan he had suggested, by which the freedman
was to be made a serf without the aid of legislation, would
thus be defeated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let the Bureau be taken away,” he replied, “and planters
will come into the arrangement. That is, all honorable
ones will; and if a man hasn’t honor enough to come in, he’ll
be scared in. If he hires my niggers, or yours, he’ll be
mobbed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. H——, of Lowndes County, often joined in our conversation.
“I don’t believe my friend G—— here believes
half he says. I am sure the South is going to make this year
a million bales,—probably much more. One thing planters
have got to learn: the old system is gone up, and we must
begin new. It won’t do to employ the old overseers; they
can’t learn to treat the freedmen like human beings. I told
my overseer the old style wouldn’t do,—the niggers wouldn’t
stand it,—and he promised better fashions; but it wasn’t
two days before he fell from grace, and went to whipping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>again. That just raised the Old Scratch with them; and I
don’t blame ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>H—— went on to say that it was necessary now to treat
the negroes like men. “We must deal justly with them;”
he had a great deal to say about justice. “We must reason
with them,—for they are reasonable beings;” and he repeated
some of the excellent homilies with which he had
enlightened their consciences and understandings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Formerly,’ I said to them, ‘you were my slaves; you
worked for me, and I provided for you. You had no thought
of the morrow, for I thought of that for you. If you were
sick, I had the doctor come to you. When you needed
clothes, clothes were forthcoming; and you never went hungry
for lack of meal and pork. You had little more responsibility
than my mules.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’But now all that is changed. Being free men, you
assume the responsibilities of free men. You sell me your
labor, I pay you money, and with that money you provide for
yourselves. You must look out for your own clothes and
food, and the wants of your children. If I advance these
things for you, I shall charge them to you, for I cannot give
them like I once did, now I pay you wages. Once if you
were ugly or lazy, I had you whipped, and that was the end
of it. Now if you are ugly and lazy, your wages will be paid
to others, and you will be turned off, to go about the country
with bundles on your backs, like the miserable low-down
niggers you see that nobody will hire. But if you are well-behaved
and industrious, you will be prosperous and respected
and happy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They all understood this talk,” added H——, “and liked
it, and went to work like men on the strength of it. If every
planter would begin that way with his freedmen, there’d be
no trouble. There’s everything in knowing how to manage
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If anybody knows how to manage them, you do,” said
G——. Then turning to me: “H—— is the shrewdest
manager in this country. There’s a good story about his
managing a nigger and a horse;—shall I tell it, H——?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>“Go ahead,” said H——, laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An old nigger of his picked up a horse the Yankee raiders
had turned loose in the country, and brought him home to
H——’s plantation. The old nigger gave the horse to his son
Sip, and died. The horse had been used up, but he turned
out to be a mighty good one,—just such an animal as H——
wanted; so he laid claim to him, and Sip had to go to the
Freedmen’s Bureau for an order to compel my friend here to
give him up. He told his story, got the order, and brought it
home, and showed it to H——, who looked at it, then looked
at Sip, and said, ‘Do you know what this paper says?’ ‘It
says I’m to have de hoss; dat’s what dey told me.’ ‘I’ll tell
you what it says,’ and H—— pretended to read the order:
‘<em>If this boy troubles you any more about that horse, give him a
sound thrashing!</em>’ ‘’Fore God,’ says Sip, ‘I done went to
de wrong man!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked to see H——, the just man, who treated his freed
people like rational beings, deny the truth of this story.</p>

<p class='c000'>“G—— has told something near the fact; but there’s one
thing he has left out. <em>I just put my Spencer to Sip’s head,
and told him if he pestered me any more about that horse, I’d
kill him.</em> He knew I was a man of my word, and he never
pestered me any more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought G—— must have intended the story as a hard hit
at H——’s honesty; but I now saw that he really meant it as
a compliment to his “shrewd management,” and that as such
H—— received it with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said I, “as you relate the circumstance, it seems to
me the horse belonged to Sip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A nigger has no use for a horse like that,” replied H——.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He had been brought on to the plantation and fed there
at H——’s expense,” explained G——.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hadn’t he done work enough to pay for his keeping?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, and ten times over,” said H——, frankly. “I foresaw
in the beginning there was going to be trouble about the
ownership of that horse. So I told my driver to kill him,—with
hard work, I mean. He tried his best to do it; but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>was such a tough beast, he did the work and grew fat all the
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was still unable to see why the horse did not belong rightfully
to Sip, instead of his master. But one thing I did see,
more and more plainly: that it was impossible for the most
honorable men who had been bred up under the institution
of slavery to deal at all times and altogether honorably with
those they had all their lives regarded as chattels. Mr. H——
was one of the fairest and most sensible men in his speech
whom I chanced to meet; and I believe that he was sincere,—or
at least meant to be sincere. I made inquiries concerning
him of his neighbors fifty miles around,—for every large
planter knows every other, at least by reputation, within a circuit
of several counties,—and all spoke of him as a just and
upright man. No doubt if I had had dealings with him I
should have found him so. He meant to give the freedmen
their rights, but he was only beginning dimly to perceive that
they had any rights; and when it came to treating a black
man with absolute justice, he did not know the meaning of the
word.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. B——, of Monroe County, was a good sample of the
hopeful class.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re brushed out, and must begin new. I’ve lost as
much as any other man, but it’s foolish to sit down and complain
of that. I believe if Southern men will only take courage,
and do their best, in five years the country will be more
prosperous than ever. When you hear it said the country is
ruined, and the niggers won’t work, the trouble is in them
that make the complaint, and not in the niggers. My niggers
say to me, ‘Massa Joe, we ought to work mo’e ’n we ever did
befo’e; for once, we just worked for our victuals and clothes,
and now we’re getting wages besides.’ And they’ll do it,—they
<em>are</em> doing it. If you want a freedman to do what he
promises, you’ve only to set him the example, and do by him
just what you promise. I’ve a negro foreman on my plantation
that has been with me twenty years; and I can trust him
to manage just as far as I can trust myself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>“Talk about the country being ruined!” B—— went on:
“I’m sick of such nonsense. Just look at it. I hire my
freedmen by the year; I give four and five dollars a month to
women, and seven and eight to men. A woman will do about
two thirds as much work ploughing, hoeing, and picking as a
man. For two months now I shall keep my women spinning
and making clothes, and my men cutting and hauling wood to
the steamboats, for which I get four dollars a cord. That will
pay their wages and more. Then what have we got to do the
rest of the year? Make a crop of cotton. If we don’t make
more than a quarter of a crop, it will pay handsomely, at present
prices; but it’s my opinion we shall make a good crop.
I used to find it profitable to pay a hundred and fifty dollars a
year for slaves, with cotton at ten cents a pound; and if I
can’t make money now, I’m a fool.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A Mobile merchant, overhearing this talk, remarked: “You
are the most hopeful man, Mr. B——, I ever saw. I don’t
know but what you say is true; but it won’t do to talk it
very loud, so they’ll hear it on the other side of the water.
It’s our policy to talk the other way, and keep the prices up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>B—— assured me that the majority of the planters in
Monroe County were of his way of thinking. They had
formed an Agricultural Association, the object of which was
“to protect and preserve the colored population, by furnishing
them employment and ministering to their wants and necessities.”
The constitution adopted by this association breathes
such a different spirit from the serf-codes of Mississippi, Louisiana,
and South Carolina, that it is refreshing and encouraging
to refer to it. I quote some of its provisions:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Article</span> 6th. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee
to look after the welfare of the freedmen, in their respective beats,
to inspect and sanction each and every contract made between the
freedmen and their employers, and to see that said freedmen are not
deceived or overreached in any contract made with the employer....
And when any contract, as aforesaid, shall be fairly and understandingly
made, it shall be the law between the parties thereto, and when
any difficulty arises between any freedman and his white employer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>relative to the construction or performance of any contract, said committeeman
may act as arbitrator between the parties, and his decision
shall be final, unless one or both of the parties desire an appeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Art.</span> 8th. It shall be the duty of all the officers of this Association,
to see that the freedman shall receive from his employer his
wages or earnings, and in case such employer refuses to pay promptly
such wages and earnings, to aid the freedman by their full power in
the collection of the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Art.</span> 9th. It shall also be the duty of this Association, and
particularly the officers thereof, to see that the freedman shall comply
with his contracts with his employer unless he can show some
good or reasonable excuse for the non-performance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Art.</span> 13th. It shall be the duty of the said Association to provide
a home for the aged and helpless freedmen of the county, and
for such others as are unable to make an honest support, and to see
that they are provided with the necessaries of life,—to devise ways
and means for their permanent relief and support.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Art.</span> 15th. It shall be the duty of this Association, and all the
officers thereof, to favor, as much as possible, the education and
schooling of the colored children in said county, and to aid in devising
ways and means, and making arrangements for having said children
properly taught and their general morals taken care of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The association taxed itself for the purpose of carrying out
the provisions of its constitution. Every planter in Monroe
County had joined it. General Swayne, Assistant-Commissioner
of the Freedmen’s Bureau for Alabama, had approved
its action, and appointed its president superintendent of freedmen
for that county. “The thing is working admirably,” said
B——. “The planters are encouraged, and the freedmen are
contented and at work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said to him: “If all the members of the association are
as sincere as yourself, and will perform what they promise;
if all the counties in the State will follow the example of Monroe;
and if other States will follow the example of Alabama,
there will be no longer any trouble about reconstruction: the
great problem of the country will be solved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said he believed so, and was sure the association would
act in good faith. And I heard afterwards that Conecuh
County had already followed the example of Monroe.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXI.<br /> <span class='large'>WILSON’S RAID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We had lovely weather, sailing up the Alabama River.
The shores were low, and covered with cane-brakes, or with
growths of water-oak, gum, sycamore, and cotton-wood trees,
with here and there dark and shaggy swamps. Then plantations
began to appear, each with its gin-house and cotton-press,
planter’s house, corn-crib, and negro-quarters, on the river’s
bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sycamores, with their white trunks covered all over
with small black spots, and heavily draped with long moss,
presented a peculiar appearance. Green tufts of the mistletoe
grew upon the leafless tree-tops. Clouds of blackbirds
sometimes covered the shore, casting a shadow as they flew.
The second day, the low shores disappeared, replaced by
pleasantly wooded bluffs and elevated plantations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly all the planters I met had been down to Mobile to
purchase their supplies for the season. Freight went ashore
at every landing. Recent rains had made the steep clayey
banks as slippery as if they had been greased; and it was
quite exciting to see the deck-hands carry up the freight,—many
a poor fellow getting a perilous fall. The wood for
the steamboat was sometimes shot from the summit of the
bluff down a long wooden spout which dropped it at the
landing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing some heavy bars of iron going ashore at one place,
I asked an old gentleman to what use they were put on the
plantation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are to make ploughs of, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does every plantation make its own ploughs?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>
<img src='images/i_434.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>“Do we make our own ploughs?” he repeated, regarding
me with astonishment and indignation. “Why, sir, it wouldn’t
be a civilized country, if we didn’t. How do you think, sir,
we should get our ploughs?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Buy them, or have them made for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Buy our ploughs! It would impoverish us, sir, if we had
to buy our ploughs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the contrary, I should think a plough-factory could
furnish them for less than they now cost you,—that, like
boots and shoes, it would be cheaper to buy them than to
make them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir! I’ve a black man on my plantation who can
make as good a plough, at as little cost, as can be made anywhere
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After that I had nothing to say, having already sufficiently
exposed my ignorance.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third day (it was the slowest trip, our captain said,
which he had made in twenty years) we reached Selma, three
hundred miles above Mobile,—a pleasantly situated town,
looking down from the level summit of a bluff that rises
almost precipitously from the river. Before the war it had
three thousand inhabitants, and exported annually near a
hundred thousand bales of cotton. It is connected by railroads
with the North and West, and by railroad and river
with Montgomery and the East. It was a point of very great
importance to the Confederacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found it a scene of “Yankee vandalism” and ruin. The
Confederate arsenal, founderies, and rolling-mills,—the most
important works of the kind in the South, covering many
acres of ground, furnished with coal and iron by the surrounding
country,—together with extensive warehouses containing
ammunition and military stores, were burned when Wilson
captured the place. A number of private stores and dwellings
were likewise destroyed; and the work of rebuilding them
was not yet half completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Climbing the steps from the landing to the level of the
town, the first object which attracted my attention was a
chain-gang of negroes at work on the street; while a number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>of white persons stood looking on, evidently enjoying the
sight, and saying to one another, “That’s the beauty of freedom!
that’s what free niggers come to!”</p>

<p class='c000'>On inquiring what the members of the chain-gang had done
to be punished in this ignominious manner, I got a list of their
misdemeanors, one of the gravest of which was “using abusive
language towards a white man.” Some had transgressed certain
municipal regulations, of which, coming in from the country,
they were very likely ignorant. One had sold farm produce
within the town limits, contrary to an ordinance which prohibits
market-men from selling so much as an egg before they
have reached the market and the market-bell has rung. For
this offence he had been fined twenty dollars, which being
unable to pay, he had been put upon the chain. Others had
been guilty of disorderly conduct, vagrancy, and petty theft,
which it was of course necessary to punish. But it was a
singular fact that no white men were ever sentenced to the
chain-gang,—being, I suppose, all virtuous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle of Selma was not a favorite topic with the citizens,
most of whom were within the stockade, or behind the
breastworks, captured by an inferior force of the Yankee
invaders. But on the subject of the burning and pillaging
that ensued they were eloquent.</p>

<p class='c000'>A gray-haired old gentleman said to me: “I was in the
trenches when Wilson came. Everybody was. I just watched
both ways, and when I saw how the cat was jumping, I threw
my musket as far as I could, dropped down as if I was killed,
and walked into town atter the Yankees. I stood by my own
gate, when four drunken fellows came up, slapped me on the
shoulder, and said, ‘This old man was in the stockade,—he’s
a Rebel!’ ‘Of course I’m a Rebel,’ I said, ‘if I’m ketched
in a Rebel trap.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“They was taking me away when an officer rode up. ‘Old
man,’ says he, ‘can you show me where the corn depot is?’
‘I reckon I kin, if these gentlemen will let me,’ I says. So I
got off; and when I had showed him the corn he let me go.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The fire was first set by our own men: that was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>cotton yards. They blazed up so quick, the Yankees couldn’t
have got thar without they went on wires. The next was the
post-office; that they burned. The next was a drug store;
the other drug store they didn’t burn, but they smashed
everything in it. The Arsenal was owing me and my family
fifteen hundred dollars, when they destroyed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They just ruined me. They took from me six cows, four
mules, fifteen hogs, fifteen hundred pounds of bacon, eight
barrels of flour, and fifty-five sacks of corn. They took my
wife’s and daughters’ clothing to carry away flour in. I saw
a man take my wife’s best dress, empty into it all the flour he
could tote, tie it up, clap it on his shoulder, and march off.
Another went off with an elegantly embroidered petticoat full
of flour swung on his arm. Another would take a pair of
ladies’ drawers, fill the legs with flour, and trot off with ’em
riding straddle of his neck. It made me feel curi’s! It
made me feel like if I had ’em down in the squirrel woods, I
could shoot a right smart passel of ’em with a will!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were one hundred and fifty dwellings burned; some
caught from the shops and warehouses, and others were said
to have been set by marauders. These robbed everybody,
even the negroes in the streets and the negro-women in their
houses. Charles Mencer, a well-known and respectable colored
man, related to me the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I worked here in a saddle-shop, at the time of Wilson’s
raid. I hired my time of my master, and had laid up two
hundred dollars in gold and silver: I had invested my earnings
in specie, and in two watches, because I knew the Confederacy
couldn’t last. The Yankees came in on Sunday
evening; they robbed my house and stole my gold and silver,
and one of my watches. Four of them stopped me in the
street, and took my other watch, and my pocket-book, with
all my Confederate money in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of this man’s story possesses a semi-historical interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The next Tuesday General Wilson sent for me; he wanted
somebody that he could trust to carry despatches for him down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>the river to General Canby, and I had been recommended to
him by some colored people. I said I would take them; and I
sewed them up in my vest collar. Then I went to my master,
and told him there was no chance for work since the Yankees
had come in, and got a pass from him to go down to Mobile
and find work. Tuesday night I started in a canoe, and paddled
down the river. I dodged the Rebel guard when I could,
but I was taken and searched twice, and got off by showing
my master’s pass. I paddled night and day, and got to Montgomery
Hill on Sunday. There I saw Federal troops, and
went ashore, and delivered myself up to the captain. He took
me to General Lucas, who sent me with a cavalry escort to
General Canby at Blakely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For this service Mencer was paid three hundred dollars in
greenbacks, which he had recently invested in a freedmen’s
newspaper, “The Constitutionalist,” just started in Mobile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The negroes everywhere sympathized with the Federal
cause, and served it when they could; but they would seldom
betray a master who had been kind to them. Many stories
were told me by the planters, illustrating this fidelity. Here
is one, related by a gentleman of Lowndes County:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Yankees, when they left Selma, passed through this
side of the river, on their way to Montgomery. The streams
were high; that hindered them, and did us a sight of damage.
I got the start of ’em, and run off my horses and mules. I
gave a valise full of valuable papers to my negro boy Arthur,
and told him to hide it. He took it, and put it in his trunk,—threw
out his own clothes to hide my property; for he didn’t
suppose the Yankees would be mean enough to rob niggers.
But they did: after they robbed my house, they went to the
negro-quarters, and pilfered them. They found my valise,
took out my old love-letters, and had a good time reading ’em
for about an hour. Then they said to Arthur,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You are your master’s confidential servant, a’n’t you?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Yes, sir,’ says Arthur, proud of the distinction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You know where he has gone with his mules and
horses?’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>“’Yes, sir, I know all about it.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Jump on to this horse, and go and show us where he is,
and we’ll give you five dollars.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I don’t betray my master for no five dollars,’ says Arthur.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Then,’ says they, ‘we’ll shoot you if you won’t show
us!’ And they put their carbines to his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He never flinched. ‘You can shoot me if you like,’ he
says, ‘but I sha’n’t betray my master!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were so struck with his courage and fidelity that
they just let him go. So I saved my horses. He don’t know
it, but I’m going to give that boy a little farm and stock it for
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another planter in Lowndes County, an old man, told me
his story, which will pass as a sample of a hundred others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Yankees burnt my gin-house and screw. They didn’t
burn my house, for they made it a rule to destroy none but
unoccupied dwellings. But they took everything from my house
they wanted, and ruined about everything they didn’t want.
They mixed salt with the sugar, emptied it on the floor, and
poured vinegar on it. They took a great fancy to a little
grandson of mine. They gave him a watch, and told him
they’d give him a little pony to ride if he would go to camp
with them. ‘I won’t go with you,’ says he, ‘for you’re taking
away all the flour that we make biscuit of.’ They carried
him a little ways, when they stopped to burn a school-house.
‘Here! You mustn’t burn that!’ he says; ‘for that’s our
school-house.’ And they didn’t burn it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Confederates used me as bad as the Yankees,” said
Mr. M——, a planter whom I saw in Macon County. “They
had taken twenty-six horses from me, when Wilson came and
took thirty more. I ran off six of my best horses to a piny
hill; and there I got on a high stump, and looked over the
bushes, to see if the Yankees were coming. I wasn’t near
as happy as I’d been some days in my life! All I thought of
was to get my horses off down one side of the hill, if I saw
the raiders coming up the other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This gentleman had been extensively engaged in the culture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>of the grape,—to which, by the way, the soil and climate of
Alabama are admirably adapted. He had in his cellar twenty
thousand dollars’ worth of wine, when Wilson came. His
wife caused it all to be destroyed, to prevent it from falling
into the hands of the soldiers. The last cask was scarcely
emptied when they arrived. “She thought she’d sooner deal
with men sober than drunk,” said M——. “They treated
her very well and took nothing from the house they didn’t
need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The route of Wilson’s cavalry can be traced all the way, by
the burnt gin-houses with which they dotted the country. At
Montgomery they destroyed valuable founderies and machine-shops,
after causing the fugitive Rebels to burn a hundred
thousand bales of cotton, with the warehouses which contained
it. I followed their track through the eastern counties of
Alabama, and afterwards recrossed it in Georgia, where the
close of hostilities terminated this, the most extensive and
destructive raid of the war.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXII.<br /> <span class='large'>NOTES ON ALABAMA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, and originally the
capital of the Confederacy, is a town of broad streets and
pleasant prospects, built on the rolling summits of high bluffs,
on the left bank of the Alabama, one hundred miles above
Selma. Before the war it had ten thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walking up the long slope of the principal street, I came to
the Capitol, a sightly edifice on a fine eminence. On a near
view, the walls, which are probably of brick, disguised to imitate
granite, had a cheap look; and the interior, especially the
Chamber of Representatives in which the Confederate egg was
hatched, appeared mean and shabby. This was a plain room,
with semicircular rows of old desks covered with green baize
exceedingly worn and foul. The floor carpet was faded and
ragged. The glaring whitewashed walls were offensive to
the eye. The Corinthian pillars supporting the gallery were
a cheap imitation of bronze. Over the Speaker’s chair hung a
sad-looking portrait of George Washington, whose solemn eyes
could not, I suppose, forget the scenes which Treason and
Folly had enacted there.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remained two days at Montgomery; saw General Swayne
and other officers of the Bureau; visited plantations in the
vicinity; and conversed with prominent men of the surrounding
counties. Both there, and on my subsequent journey
through the eastern part of the State, I took copious notes,
which I shall here compress within as small a space as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already sketched the class of planters one meets on
steamboats and railroads. These are generally men who mix
with the world, read the newspapers, and feel the current of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>progressive ideas. Off the main routes of travel, you meet with
a different class,—men who have never emerged from their
obscurity, who do not read the newspapers, and who have not
yet learned that the world moves. Many of them were anti-secessionists;
which fact renders them often the most troublesome
people our officers now have to deal with. Claiming to
be Union men, they cannot understand why their losses,
whether of slaves or other property, which the war occasioned,
should not be immediately made up to them by the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in Mississippi and Tennessee, the small farmers in the
Alabama legislature were the bitterest negro-haters in that
body; while the more liberal-minded and enlightened members
were too frequently controlled by a back-country constituency,
whom they feared to offend by voting for measures
which ignorance and obstinacy were sure to disapprove.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Alabama, as in all the Southern States, the original
secessionists were generally Democrats and the Union men
Old Line Whigs. The latter opposed the revolution until it
swept them away; when they often went into the war with
a zeal which shamed the shirking policy of many who were
very hot in bringing it on, and very cool in keeping out of it.
I found them now the most hopeful men of the South. If a
planter said to me, “I’m going to raise a big crop of cotton
this year,—my negroes are working finely,”—I needed no
other test that he belonged to this class.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the loyalty of the people I shall give the testimony
of a very intelligent young man of Chambers County,—whose
story will in other respects prove instructive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I enlisted in the Confederate Army for one year; and
before my time was up I was conscripted for two years; then,
before these expired, I was conscripted for two more. I was
made prisoner at Forest Hill, in Virginia, and taken to Harrisburg,
in Pennsylvania. At the end of the war I was paroled.
I knew that my people were ruined, and all my property gone.
That consisted in twelve slaves; their labor supported me
before the war, but now I had nothing but my own hands to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>depend upon. I made up my mind to stay where I was and
go to work. I hired out to a farmer for six dollars a month.
I had never done a stroke of labor in my life, and it came hard
to me at first. But I soon got used to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One day a merchant of Harrisburg was riding by, and he
asked me some questions which I answered. A few days after
he came that way again, got into conversation with me, and
proposed to me to go into his store. He offered me eighteen
dollars a month. I said to him, ‘You are very kind, sir, but
you probably do not know who I am, or you would not want
me: I am a Rebel soldier, just out of prison.’ He said he
believed I was an honest fellow, and would like to try me. I
went into his store, and after the first month he raised my
wages to thirty dollars. After the second month, he gave me
forty, and after the third month he gave me fifty. I had been
a wild boy before the war; I had plenty of money with no
restrictions upon my spending it. But I tell you I was never
so happy in my life as when I was at work for my living in
that store. My employer liked me, and trusted me, and I
liked the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have now come home on a visit. My relations and
neighbors are very much incensed against me because I tell
them plainly what I think of the Yankees. I know now that
we were all in the wrong, and that the North was right, about
the war; and I tell them so. I have met with the most insulting
treatment on this account. They feel the bitterest animosity
against the government, and denounce and abuse the
Yankees, and call me a Yankee, as the worst name they can
give me. To you, a Northern man, I suppose they won’t say
much; but they talk among themselves and to me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How large a proportion of your people express such sentiments?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, there are fifteen hundred voting men in the
county; and all but about a hundred and eighty feel and talk
the way I tell you. They can’t be reconciled to living under
the old government, and those who are able are preparing to
emigrate. A fund has already been raised to send agents to
select lands for them in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>“Did you find in the North any such animosity existing
towards the people of the South?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very little; and there was this difference: In the North
it is only a few ignorant people, of the poorer class, who hate
the South: I believe the mass of the Northern people, while
they hate treason and rebellion, have only kind feelings towards
the Southern people. But with us it is the wealthy
and influential class that hates the North, while only the poor
whites and negroes have any loyalty at heart. I wish,” he
added, “that for every Northern man now settling in the
South, a Southern man would go into business at the North,
and see for himself, as I have done, just what sort of people
and institutions we have all our lives been taught to misunderstand
and slander.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The editors of the southern half of the State were nearly
all disloyal, judged by their prints. The same may be said
of the ministers of the aristocratic churches, judged by their
words and works.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a wide difference between the people of Northern
and Southern Alabama. The inhabitants of many of the
upper counties were as loyal as those of East Tennessee. In
some it was necessary for the Davis government to maintain
a cavalry force in order to keep the people in subjection. Such
a county was Randolph, whose inhabitants were as strongly
opposed to secession, as those of Chambers County, its next
neighbor on the South, were in favor of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The commanders discriminated in their foraging against
the Union people. The fact that a man was absent in the
service of the United States, or was opposed to the rebellion,
was deemed a sufficient warrant to take the last piece of meat
from his smoke-house, and the last ear of corn and bundle of
fodder from his barns, leaving his family to starve. Randolph
alone furnished nearly five hundred men who actually took
up arms in the service of the United States, enlisting in whatever
organization they found convenient as they made their
escape from the Rebel conscripting officers into our lines.
Their graves are upon every battle-field, attesting their bravery,
their patriotism, and their sacrifices.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Thus wrote, in a private letter to General Swayne, Lieutenant
R. T. Smith, himself a loyal Alabamian who served in
the Union army. The county was impoverished by the absence
of its men in both armies, and by the troopers who
preyed upon it. There was still great suffering at the time
of my visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Much destitution also exists,” said the lieutenant, “among
the families of the late Rebels; for the soldiery, who had
come in the beginning partly at their instance, consumed
their substance when the means of the Union people were
exhausted. Like Actæon, they were eaten by their own
dogs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a common, an every-day sight in Randolph County,
to see women and children, most of whom were formerly in
good circumstances, begging for bread from door to door.
They must have immediate help, or perish. Fifteen hundred
families, embracing five thousand persons, are in need of immediate
aid.” This was in January, 1866.</p>

<p class='c000'>The destitution here described was not confined to a portion
of the country, nor was it a new thing. In 1863, the
shortness of the crops, the depreciation of the currency, and
the consequent high prices of provisions, produced a famine
among the poorer classes. The families of soldiers, fighting
the battles of a confederacy which paid them in worthless
paper, were left to suffer the extremes of want, while many,
who helped to bring on the war, were growing rich by speculating
upon the misery it occasioned. In Mobile there were
insurrections of women, driven by starvation to acts of public
violence. The State was finally awakened to the necessity of
ameliorating these sufferings; and during the last year of the
war it fed with meal and salt one hundred and forty thousand
white paupers.</p>

<p class='c000'>This charity, inherited, in a manner, by the government
which feeds the enemy it subjugates, was continued, after the
war had closed, with the aid of the United States Commissary
Department. At the same time the emancipation of four
hundred and fifty thousand slaves,—nearly half the population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>of the State,—threw a large number of black paupers
upon the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these circumstances, the Freedmen’s Bureau proved an
instrument of inestimable good. Its mediatory and organizing
influence prevented outbreaks, and saved thousands from perishing.
It assumed the care of homeless blacks and of white
refugees. It colonized the former upon abandoned lands, and
thence supplied many plantations with labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the month of August, 1865, there were at one of these
colonies thirty-four hundred freedmen. “I have been sending
paupers to it ever since,” said General Swayne; “and there
are now but one hundred and fifty persons there.” This was
in January. At that time the Bureau was feeding less than
twenty-five hundred blacks, and the number was rapidly
diminishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>No freedmen’s courts had been established by the Bureau
in Alabama. “We had not officers enough to establish more
than ten courts,” General Swayne told me. “And when
those were withdrawn, the negro would have been left defenceless.
I therefore preferred to educate the civil courts to
do the freedmen justice.” He had displayed considerable
diplomatic skill in securing the coöperation of the Convention,
and getting an ordinance passed by it, which authorized
civil officers to try freedmen’s cases and receive negro
testimony. If an officer failed of his duty towards the blacks,
his commission as an agent of the Bureau was revoked. General
Swayne thought the system was working well; but he
confessed that these officers required close watching; and
some of his special agents, who came more directly in contact
with the people, and with the actual crude state of
affairs, while he saw them too much perhaps through the atmosphere
of influential State officials, assured me that the
justice obtained by the freedmen from these courts was but
scanty. “At the outset,” said one, “they meet with obstacles.
If they enter a complaint, they must give bail to appear
as witnesses, or be lodged in jail. As no white man will
give bail for a negro to appear as a witness against a white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>man, and as they don’t fancy lying perhaps weeks in jail in
order to be heard, they prefer to suffer wrong rather than seek
redress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were but two freedmen’s schools in the State, one at
Montgomery, and another at Mobile, with an aggregate of
fifteen teachers and nine hundred pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everywhere I heard complaints of the demoralization of the
people occasioned by the war. There were throughout the
South organized bands of thieves. In Alabama, cotton-stealing
had become a safe and profitable business. I was told of
men, formerly respectable, and who still held their heads high
in society, who were known to have made large fortunes by it.
These men employ negroes to do the work, because negroes
cannot give legal evidence against a white man. During the
last three months of 1865, it was estimated that, on the line
of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, ten thousand bales of cotton
had been stolen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crimes of every description, especially upon the property
and persons of the freedmen, were very common. General
Swayne told me that he stood greatly in need of a force of
cavalry, without which it was almost impossible to arrest the
offenders.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was every prospect of a good cotton crop the present
year. Since the invention of the spinning-jenny by Arkwright,
and of the gin by Whitney, the culture of this great
staple has received no such impulse as the recent high prices
have given it. The planters were taking courage, the freedmen
were at work, and a large amount of Northern capital
was finding investment in the State. Even the poor whites,
who never before would consent to degrade themselves by
industrious labor in the field, seemed inspired by the general
activity, and many of them, for the first time in their lives,
were preparing to raise a few bales of cotton. Labor was not
abundant. “Our best young men went off with the Yankee
army; and our best girls followed the officers.” Men of sense
and reputation had not much difficulty, however, in securing
laborers. “When I got all ready to hire,” said one, “I just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>turned about four hundred hogs into a field near the road.
Every freedman that came that way stopped; and in a week
I had as many as I wanted. They all like to hire out where
there is plenty of pork.” Others, to fill their quota of hands,
were paying the fines of stout negroes on the chain-gangs, and
bailing those who were lying in jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>All sorts of contracts were entered into; and various devices
were used to stimulate the energies of the freedmen. Some
paid wages; some gave a share in the crop; and I heard of
planters who defrayed all expenses, and gave five cents a
pound for the cotton raised on their lands. One man, who
hired sixty freedmen at moderate wages, divided them into six
gangs of ten each, and offered a premium of three hundred
dollars to the gang which should produce the greatest number
of bales.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Swayne estimated that there were five thousand
Northern men in the State, engaged in planting and trading.
Many of them were late army-officers. Business in the principal
towns had been paying large profits; and Northern merchants,
who purchased their goods at the North, were, notwithstanding
the popular prejudice against them, enabled to
compete with, and undersell, native traders who bought in
smaller quantities and at second hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hilly northern part of Alabama falls off gradually
through the rolling prairies and alluvial bottoms of the central,
to the low, flat southern portion of the State. Much of this
latter region is sandy and barren, producing little besides poor
whites and sweet potatoes. There are fertile bottom lands,
however, adapted to the sugar-cane; and rice has also been
successfully cultivated near the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the lower half of the State, the long tree-moss
grows with great luxuriance. It flourishes in a warm, moist
climate; and the forests of the entire Southern country, below
thirty-three degrees, are festooned by it. It likes the dank
and heavy shade of swamps, which it darkens still more with
its pendant shrouds. In favorable localities it grows to a great
length, till its long-fibred masses appear dripping from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>trees. One can imagine the effect when the great winds move
through the woods, and to their solemn roaring is added the
weird, unearthly aspect of a myriad gloomy banners, waving
and beckoning from every limb.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gathered by means of hooks attached to long poles, and
seasoned by a simple process, this moss becomes a valuable article
of merchandise, being principally used in the manufacture
of mattresses. I saw many bales of it going down the rivers
to New Orleans, Mobile, and Savannah. Its color on the
boughs is a dull greenish gray; but when prepared for market,
it resembles black crinkled horse-hair. A gentleman of
Charleston told me that just before the war he tried the experiment
of sending a bale of it to France, where it was not
permitted to pass the custom-house until his factor had obtained
from him a properly attested certificate, showing that it was
to be taxed, not as hair, but as a vegetable substance. The
French called it “vegetable horse-hair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The best cotton lands of Alabama lie between the Alabama
and Tombigbee rivers, where a bale to the acre is the usual
yield. The valleys of the Black Warrior and some lesser
streams are scarcely inferior.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general fertility of the great central portion of the
State is offset by two or three disadvantages. One is the mud
of the “black lime land,” which, in the rainy season, is often of
such depth and tenacity that travel on the roads by means of
wheeled vehicles is impracticable. A greater inconvenience is
the scarcity of wells. In the northern portion of the State
good water is abundant; but in other parts plantations are
supplied only by means of house and field cisterns. In some
towns excellent Artesian wells have been constructed; a few
reaching a depth of a thousand feet, and throwing water in
sufficient volume and force to carry machinery. At Selma
there were lately two very good flowing wells, but on an attempt
being made to bore a third, a rock was split, which injured
materially the condition of the two first. In the large
public square at Montgomery, the broad circular basin of the
Artesian well, surrounded by an iron railing on a stone curb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>visited by throngs of citizens, descending the steps, dipping up
the water, or catching it as it gushes from the spout, and filling
their pails and casks, forms an interesting feature of the
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the northern part of Alabama there are beautiful and
fertile valleys adapted to the culture of both cotton and grain.
On the other hand, there are hills unfit for cultivation. Between
these two extremes there are upland tracts of moderate
fertility, capable of producing a third or a quarter of a bale to
the acre. This is the region of small farms and few negroes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The climate throughout the elevated portions of the State is
healthy and delightful. On the low river bottoms there is
much suffering from fevers and mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The common-school system of Alabama is very imperfect.
The wealthy planters send their children to private schools,
and object to taxation for the education of the children of the
poor. The poor, on the other hand, take no interest in schools,
to which they will not send their children as long as money is
to be paid for tuition, or as long as there is cotton to pick and
wood to cut at home. The isolation of the inhabitants on
plantations, or in widely scattered log-cabins, and the presence
of an uneducated race forming nearly one half the population,
have been great obstacles in the way of popular education.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alabama has a common-school fund, derived principally
from lands, comprising the sixteenth section in each township,
given for educational purposes by the United States. This
fund has never been consolidated, but each township enjoys
the income, by sale or rent, of its own allotted portion. The
system works badly. The sixteenth section is valueless in
many of the townships where both the land and the inhabitants
are poor, and where there is consequently most need of
educational assistance; while in townships occupied by planters
who have grown rich on the richness of the soil, and who need
no such assistance, it has generally proved very valuable. Mr.
Taylor, the State Superintendent of Schools, told me that in
one of these wealthier townships, in Montgomery County,
there was for some years but a single child to whose education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>the sixteenth-section fund could be properly applied. She was
a girl; and the independent planters performed their duty
faithfully in her case. They sent her to a boarding-school,
where she received a fashionable education; and, when she
came to marry, furnished her wedding-outfit, and presented
her with a piano.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alabama is comparatively a new State. Admitted into the
Union in 1819, her rise in importance has kept pace steadily
with the progress of modern cotton cultivation. It sounds
strange to hear planters still young refer to their experiences
in the early days of cotton in regions which are now celebrated
for its production. “I came to Montgomery County in 1834,”
said one. “I raised my first cotton crop in 1836. I had nine
negroes, and I made a bale to the hand. They didn’t know
how to pick it. So I hired thirty Indian girls to pick,—as
handsome young creatures as ever you saw. Cotton was then
eighteen cents a pound. The Indian war disturbed us some;
but I and a dozen more settlers went out and killed more
Indians than all Scott’s army. I have now two large plantations;
this year I work a hundred and ten hands, and fifty-five
mules and horses, on thirteen hundred acres of cotton
and five hundred of corn; and I intend to make more money
than ever before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal railroads of the State were all in running
condition; although the rolling stock was generally shabby
and scarce. The Montgomery and West Point Road, which
Wilson’s raiders damaged to the amount of several millions,
had been temporarily repaired. Depots were never plenty in
the South, and where our forces had passed, not one was left;—a
great inconvenience, especially to single gentlemen, going
to take the train at two or three o’clock in the morning, finding
the cars locked and guarded until the ladies should all be
seated, and compelled to wait perhaps an hour, in the cold, for
them to be opened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>IN AND ABOUT ATLANTA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The railroad runs eastward from Montgomery, forks at
Opelika, and enters Georgia by two divergent routes,—the
south branch crossing the Chattahoochee at Columbus, and the
north branch at West Point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilson, the Raider, paid his respects to both these roads.
The main body of his troops proceeded to Columbus, (one of
the principal towns of Georgia,) which they carried by assault,
with a loss of but thirty men, capturing fifteen hundred
prisoners, twenty-four pieces of artillery, and immense military
stores. At the same time Lagrange’s Brigade took West
Point. These were the closing battles of the great war of the
rebellion. Pushing on towards Macon, Wilson’s advance was
met, not by bloody opposition, but by a flag of truce announcing
the surrender of Lee and the armistice between
Sherman and Johnston.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning our loss at West Point I was not able to obtain
very exact information. A citizen, who claimed to have been
in the fight, said to me, “We had seven men killed, and we
just slaughtered over three hundred Yankees.” A negro
said: “I saw five dead Yankees, and if there was any more
nobody knows what was done with ’em.” A returned Confederate
soldier, who regarded with great contempt the little
affair the citizens bragged so much about, said it was no fight
at all; the militia gave up the fort almost without a struggle;
and there were not over a dozen men killed on both sides.
The fort was situated on a high hill; and one old man, who
was in it, told me they could not hold it because they couldn’t
use the guns effectively,—they “couldn’t elevate ’em down
enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>The Yankees had the credit of behaving very well at West
Point. “They were going to burn the railroad depot, full of
rolling stock; but a lady told ’em that would set her house, so
they just run the cars off down the track, over a hundred of
’em, and fired ’em there,”—the black ruins remaining to
attest the fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving West Point at noon I reached Atlanta at seven
o’clock in the evening. It was a foggy night; the streets
were not lighted, the hotels were full, and the mud, through
which I tramped from one to the other, with a dark guide and
a very dark lantern, was ankle deep on the crossings. I was
at length fortunate enough to find lodgings, with a clergyman
and a cotton-speculator, in an ancient tavern-room, where we
were visited all night by troops of rats, scampering across the
floor, rattling newspapers, and capering over our beds. In
the morning, it was discovered that the irreverent rogues had
stolen the clergyman’s stockings.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sun-bright morning did not transmute the town into a
place of very great attractiveness. Everywhere were ruins
and rubbish, mud and mortar and misery. The burnt streets
were rapidly rebuilding; but in the mean while hundreds of
the inhabitants, white and black, rendered homeless by the
destruction of the city, were living in wretched hovels, which
made the suburbs look like a fantastic encampment of gypsies
or Indians. Some of the negro huts were covered entirely
with ragged fragments of tin-roofing from the burnt government
and railroad buildings. Others were constructed partly
of these irregular blackened patches, and partly of old boards,
with roofs of huge, warped, slouching shreds of tin, kept from
blowing away by stones placed on the top. Notwithstanding
the ingenuity displayed in piecing these rags together, they
formed but a miserable shelter at the best. “In dry weather,
it’s good as anybody’s houses. But they leaks right bad when
it rains; then we have to pile our things up to keep ’em dry.”
So said a colored mother of six children, whose husband was
killed “fighting for de Yankees,” and who supported her family
of little ones by washing. “Sometimes I gits along tolerable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>sometimes right slim; but dat’s de way wid everybody;—times
is powerful hard right now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Every business block in Atlanta was burned, except one.
The railroad machine-shops, the founderies, the immense rolling-mill,
the tent, pistol, gun-carriage, shot-and-shell factories,
and storehouses, of the late Confederacy, disappeared in flames
and explosions. Half a mile of the principal street was destroyed.
Private residences remained, with a few exceptions.
The wooden houses of the suburbs had been already torn
down, and their materials used to construct quarters for Sherman’s
men. The African Methodist Episcopal Church, built
by the colored people with their hard earnings, and viewed
by them with as much pride and satisfaction as the Jews felt
in the contemplation of the great Temple at Jerusalem, was
also demolished by our soldiers,—at the instigation, it is said,
of a white citizen living near, who thought the negro’s religious
shoutings a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I came back in May,” said a refugee, “the city
was nothing but piles of brick and ruins. It didn’t seem it
could ever be cleared. But in six weeks new blocks began
to spring up, till now you see more stores actually in operation
than we ever had before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The new business blocks were mostly one-story structures,
with cheap temporary roofs, designed to be rebuilt and raised
in more prosperous times. Nine stores of this description had
just been put up by a Connecticut man; each costing three
thousand dollars, and renting for twenty-five hundred. “He
run a rolling-mill for the Confederate Government during the
war; sold out when Sherman was coming; called himself a
good Union man;—a mighty shrewd fellow!” said one who
knew him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here and there, between the new buildings, were rows of
shanties used as stores, and gaps containing broken walls and
heaps of rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rents were enormous. Fifteen and twenty dollars a month
were charged for huts which a respectable farmer would hardly
consider good enough for his swine. One man had crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>into his backyard five of these little tenements, which rented
for fifteen dollars a month each, and a very small brick house
that let for thirty dollars. Other speculators were permitting
the construction, on their premises, of houses that were to be
occupied rent-free, for one year, by the poor families that built
them, and afterwards to revert to the owners of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The destitution among both white and black refugees was
very great. Many of the whites had lost everything by the
war; and the negroes that were run off by their masters in
advance of Sherman’s army, had returned to a desolate place,
with nothing but the rags on their backs. As at nearly every
other town of any note in the South which I visited, the small-pox
was raging at Atlanta, chiefly among the blacks, and the
suffering poor whites.</p>

<p class='c000'>I stopped to talk with an old man building a fence before
the lot containing the ruins of his burnt house. He said:
“The Yankees didn’t generally burn private dwellings. It’s
my opinion these were set by our own citizens, that remained
after Sherman’s order that all women who had relatives in the
Southern army should go South, and all males must leave
the city except them that would work for government. I put
for Chattanooga. My house was plundered, and I reckon,
burnt, by my own neighbors,—for I’ve found some of my
furniture in their houses. Some that stayed acted more honorably;
they put out fires that had been set, and saved both
houses and property. My family is now living in that shebang
there. It was formerly my stable. The weather-boards had
been ripped off, but I fixed it up the best I could to put my
little ’uns in till we can do better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another old man told me the story of his family’s sufferings,
with tears running down his cheeks. “During the battle
of July, I had typhoid fever in my house. One of my
daughters died, and my other three were down with it. The
cemeteries were being shelled, and I had to take out my dead
child and bury her hastily in my backyard. My house was
in range of the shells; and there my daughters lay, too sick
to be moved.” His description of those terrible days I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>not repeat. At length his neighbors came with ambulances,
and the sick daughters were removed. They were scarcely
out of the house when a shell passed through it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walking out, one Sunday afternoon, to visit the fortifications,
I stopped to look at a negro’s horse, which had been
crippled by a nail in his foot. While I was talking with the
owner, a white man and two negroes, who had been sitting by
a fire in an open rail-cabin close by, conversing on terms of
perfect equality, came out to take part in the consultation,
around the couch of the sick beast. One proffered one remedy;
another, another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If ye had some tare,” said the white man (meaning tar);—“open
his huf, and bile tare and pour int’ it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His lank frame and slouching dress,—his sallow visage, with
its sickly, indolent expression,—his lazy, spiritless movements,
and the social intimacy that appeared to exist between him
and the negroes, indicated that he belonged to the class known
as “Sand Hillers” in South Carolina, “Clay-eaters” in
North Carolina, “Crackers” in Georgia, and “white trash”
and “poor whites” everywhere. Among all the individuals
of this unfortunate and most uninteresting class, whom I
have seen, I do not remember a specimen better worth describing.
I give his story in his own words.</p>

<p class='c000'>He told me his name was Jesse Wade. “I lived down
in Cobb,” (that is, Cobb County,)—seating himself on the
neap of the negro’s wagon, and mechanically scraping the
mud from it with his thumb-nail. “I was a Union man, I
was that, like my daddy befo’e me. Thar was no use me bein’
a fule ’case my neighbors was. The Rebel army treated us a
heap wus’n Sherman did. I refugeed,—left everything keer
o’ my wife. I had four bales o’ cotton, and the Rebs burnt
the last bale. I had hogs, and a mule, and a hoss, and they
tuk all. They didn’t leave my wife narry bedquilt. When
they’d tuk what they wanted, they put her out the house and
sot fire to ’t. Narry one o’ my boys fit agin the Union; they
was conscripted with me, and one night we went out on guard
together, we did, and jest put for the Yankees. All the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>that had a little property went in for the wa’, but the po’ people
was agin it. Sherman was up yer to Kenesaw Mountain then,
and I left, I did, to jine him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Wade claimed to have acted as a scout, and referred me to
the quartermaster: “This one that’s yer,” (the quartermaster
at Atlanta,) “you ax him what Wade done, if you don’t reckon
I tell the truth.” He pronounced the division of the Federal
forces a great stroke of strategy. “Atter we split the army,
the Rebels couldn’t hold us no back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was very poor. “I’ve got two hosses and a wagon,
and I shouldn’t have them if Sherman hadn’t gin ’em tu me.”
He held up his feet, and looked at his toes protruding through
great gaps in his shoes. “I kain’t git money enough to buy
me a new pair, to save my life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I beat ye, then,” said the owner of the crippled horse,
showing a very good pair of boots.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>You</em>’re drayin’,” said Wade. “<em>I</em> haul. I’m gittin’ wood
to the halves. The owner’s as strong an old secessioner as
ever lived. I kain’t make but tu loads a day, and one’s mine,
and one’s the feller’s; I give one load for t’ other. Takes me
three loads to git a cord; I git a dollar and a half, and sometime
tu, for a load. I’ve got one boy that helps,—he’s about
as high as hand boy standin’ hander,” (yond’ boy standing
yonder,)—pointing to a negro lad of fourteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked Wade how old he was. “I’m in my fifty-one year
old,” he replied; “and thar’s eight on us in the family, and
tu hosses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired concerning education in his county. “Thar’s a
heap o’ po’ men in Cobb that kain’t read nor write. I’m one.
I never went to skule narry time, and I was alluz so tight run
I never could send my chil’n, only ’tween crap time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by ‘<em>’tween crap time</em>’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I’d laid by my crap,” (that is, stopped hoeing it, as
corn,) “till fodder pullin’. I alluz had to make a little cotton,
to keep up. I could alluz rent land befo’e the wa’, by givin’
half to the owners,—them a pound o’ cotton, and me a pound
o’ cotton; them a load and me a load. That’s tu much; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>I kain’t git it for that now. You might as well try to git their
eyes as their land.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Wade’s theory of reconstruction was simple, and expressed
in few words: “We should tuk the land, as we did the niggers,
and split it, and gin part to the niggers and part to me
and t’ other Union fellers. They ’d have had to submit to it,
as they did to the niggers.” I also found the freedmen, who
had gathered about us, unanimously of this opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wade,” I said, “you’re a candid man: now tell me
which you think will do the most work,—a white man, or a
nigger?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The nigger,” said Wade, surprised at so simple a question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to say that one of these black men will do
more work than you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sho’e,” (sure.)</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the reason of that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Case they was allus put mo’e at it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went on to complain that he couldn’t always get pay
for the work he did. “A man owes me money for wood. If
he don’t pay me soon, I’ll take a stick and beat it out on him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’ll be to work for it twict, and not git it then,” observed
a negro, very wisely; and I trust Wade was persuaded
not to try the stick.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ought to have such laws yer as dey has up in Tennessee,”
said another negro. “Dar you’d git yer money! Laws is
strick in Tennessee! Ebery man chalks a line up dar. A man
owes you money, de probo’ marshal make him toe de line. I’s
been round, since de wa’ busted, and I han’t seen no whar
laws like dey got up dar in Tennessee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time a large number of negroes had assembled on
the spot, dressed in their Sunday clothes; and such an animated
discussion of their political rights ensued, that, concluding
I had strayed by mistake into an out-door convention
of the freed people, I quietly withdrew,—followed by my
friend Wade, who wished to know if I could accommodate
him to a “chaw of tobacker.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Atlanta is the centre of a “perfect crow’s-foot of railroads,”
which have given it its business and military importance. The
Western and Atlantic Road, connecting it with Chattanooga,
forms a main trunk, with tributaries running into it from all
parts of the North and West, and with branches from Atlanta
running to all parts of the South. This road was constructed
by the State, which in past years derived from it a large revenue.
The war left it in a bad condition, with a dilapidated
track, and merely temporary bridges in place of those which
had been destroyed;—without machine-shops, or materials
for the repair of what little remained of the old, worn-out
rolling-stock. A purchase of four hundred thousand dollars’
worth of indispensable stock from the government, had sufficed
to put it in operation, and it was contributing something, by
its earnings, towards the great outlay still necessary to refurnish
it and place it in thorough repair. The other railroads in
the State, built by private companies, were nearly all doing well,
by reason of the great amount of freight and travel passing
over them. Those destroyed by Sherman belonged to corporations
which could best afford to rebuild them; and work
upon them was going forward with considerable vigor. All
these roads had heavy claims against the Confederate Government;
some of them amounting to several millions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Georgia, before the war, had over twelve hundred miles of
railroad in operation, forming the most extensive and complete
system south of Tennessee and Virginia,—Alabama having
but five hundred miles, and Mississippi seven hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best of the old Georgia banks were connected with the
railroads. The bills of the Georgia Railroad and Banking
Company were still worth, after the war had swept over the
State, ninety-five per cent. of their par value. Those of the
Central Railroad and Banking Company were selling for
about the same. The issues of the other banks were worth
from five to seventy-five per cent.; the stock being sacrificed.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>DOWN IN MIDDLE GEORGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As my first view of Atlanta was had on a dismal night, (if
view it could be called,) so my last impression of it was received
on a foggy morning, which showed me, as I sat in the
cars of the Macon train, waiting at the depot, groups of rain-drenched
negroes around out-door fires; the dimly seen trees
of the Park; tall ruins looming through the mist; Masonic
Hall standing alone (having escaped destruction); squat
wooden buildings of recent, hasty construction, beside it;
windrows of bent railroad iron by the track; piles of brick;
a small mountain of old bones from the battle-fields, foul and
wet with the drizzle; a heavy coffin-box, marked “glass,” on
the platform; with mud and litter all around.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tide of negro emigration was at that time flowing westward,
from the comparatively barren hills of Northern Georgia
to the rich cotton plantations of the Mississippi. Every day
anxious planters from the Great Valley were to be met with,
inquiring for unemployed freedmen, or returning home with
colonies of laborers, who had been persuaded to quit their old
haunts by the promise of double wages in a new country.
Georgia planters, who raise but a bale of cotton on three,
four, or five acres, could not compete with their more wealthy
Western neighbors: they higgled at paying their freedmen six
or seven dollars a month, while Arkansas and Mississippi men
stood ready to give twelve and fifteen dollars, and the expenses
of the journey. As it cost no more to transport able-bodied
young men and women than the old and the feeble, the former
were generally selected and the latter left behind. Thus it
happened that an unusually large proportion of poor families
remained about Atlanta and other Georgia towns.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>There were two such families huddled that morning under
the open shed of the depot. They claimed that they had
been hired by a planter, who had brought them thus far, and,
for some reason, abandoned them. They had been at the
depot a week or more, sleeping in piles of old rags, and subsisting
on rations issued to them by the Bureau: stolid-looking
mothers, hardened by field-labor, smoking short black pipes;
and older children tending younger ones, feeding them out of
tin cups, and rocking them to sleep in their arms. It was
altogether a pitiful sight,—although, but for the rain which
beat in upon them, I might have thought their freely ventilated
lodgings preferable to some of the tavern-rooms I had
lately slept in. But to me the most noticeable feature of the
scene was the spirit manifested towards these poor creatures
by spectators of my own color.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That baby’s going to die,” said one man. “Half your
children will be dead before spring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you like freedom?” said another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Niggers are fated,” said a third. “About one out of fifty
will take care of himself; the rest are gone up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Southern people are the niggers’ best friends,” resumed
the first speaker. “They feel a great deal of sympathy
for them. There are many who give them a heap of good
advice when they leave them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Good advice is cheap; but nobody gave these homeless ones
anything else, nor even that,—with a single exception: there
was one who gave them kind words and money, but he was a
Yankee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remarks of the ladies in the car were equally edifying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much better they were off with somebody to take
care of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh dear, yes! I declare it makes me hate an Abolitionist!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The government ought to have given them houses!”—(sneeringly.)
“If I had seven children to take care of, I’d
go back and sell ’em to my old master.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do see that little bit of a baby! it’s a-kicking and screaming!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>I declare, it’s white! one of the young Federals’, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From Atlanta, until within about twenty-five miles of Macon,
the railroad runs upon a ridge, from which the waters of
the country flow each way,—those of the west side, through
the Flint River and the Appalachicola to the Gulf; those of
the east, through the Ocmulgee and Altamaha to the Atlantic.
The soil of this ridge is sandy, with a mixture of red
clay; much of it producing little besides oaks and pines. The
doorways of the log-huts and shabby framed houses we passed,
were crowded with black, yellow, and sallow-white faces,—women,
children, and slatternly, barefoot girls, with long, uncombed
hair on their shoulders,—staring at the train. The
country is better, a little back from the railroad, as is frequently
the case in the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>Macon, at the head of steamboat navigation on the Ocmulgee
River, and the most important interior town in the State,
is a place of broad, pleasant streets, with a sandy soil which
exempts it from mud. It had in 1860 eight thousand inhabitants.
As it was a sort of city of refuge, “where everybody
was run to,” during the latter years of the war, its population
had greatly increased. Hundreds of white refugees from
other parts of the country were still crowded into it, having
no means of returning to their homes, or having no homes to
return to. The corporation of Macon showed little disposition
to relieve these unfortunate people, and the destitution and
suffering among them were very great. They were kept from
starvation by the government. “To get rid of feeding them,”
said Colonel Lambert, Sub-Assistant-Commissioner of the
Freedmen’s Bureau, “we are now giving them free transportation
wherever they wish to go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By a recent census, taken with a view to catching vagrants
and setting them to work, the colored population of Macon
was shown to be four thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
“All those who are not now employed will soon be
taken by the planters. If any will not hire out, they will be
set to earning their living on the public streets. I have now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>on hand applications from Alabama and Mississippi planters
for three hundred laborers; I could fill the orders if I chose
to, for the negroes are much disposed to emigrate. But all
the freedmen in the counties of my district are needed here,
and I encourage them to remain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Lambert had on hand sixteen cases of murder and
felonious shooting by white persons, negroes being the victims.
The seventeenth case was reported from Twiggs County,
while I was at Macon. A chivalrous sportsman, apparently
for the fun of the thing, took a shot at a negro walking
peaceably along the street, and killed him. The Colonel sent
out twenty-five mounted men to hunt the murderer; but it
was almost impossible to make arrests in such cases. There
were in every place unprincipled men who approved the crime
and helped to shield the criminal. Warned by them of the
approach of blue uniforms, he would betake himself to the
cane-brakes, or to some friendly garret, where he would lie
safely concealed until the scouts had given up their search for
him and retired from the neighborhood. These negro-shooters
and their accomplices were no doubt a small minority of the
people, but they were a very dangerous minority, whom the
better class did not deem it prudent to offend by assisting
the officers of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crimes of this description were more or less frequent in districts
remote from the military posts. In some places the freedmen
were shot down in mere wantonness and malice. In others,
the very men who had been wishing them all dead or driven
out of the country, had become enraged at seeing them emigrate
for higher wages than they were willing to pay, and
sworn to kill any that attempted to leave the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Said Colonel Lambert: “To prevent these outrages, we
need a much greater military force than we have. But the
force we have is being reduced by the mustering out of more
troops. We are thus prevented from carrying out the intentions
of the government; and there is danger that before long
the continuance of its authority here will be regarded as a
mere farce. What we need is cavalry; but our troops are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>infantry. I mount them in a case of emergency, where some
desperado is to be hunted, by seizing horses at the first livery-stable,
which we return after we have got through with them,
politely thanking the proprietor in the name of the government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The southwestern part of Georgia is one of the most fertile
sections of the South: it is the region of large plantations and
rich planters. The northern half of the State is comparatively
unproductive: it is the region of small planters, and of
farmers who do their own work with the aid of their sons.
Much of the northwestern part is barren. The fertile Southwest
suffered little damage from the war; it came out of it with
its plantations unimpaired, and a large stock of cotton on hand.
Northern and Middle Georgia were ploughed with the furrows
of desolation. Sherman’s army left nothing in its track but
poverty and ruin. Plantations were wasted, provisions taken,
stock killed or driven away, buildings and farming implements
destroyed. The people were left very poor: they raised no
crops in ’65, and a famine was very generally anticipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this condition, all the better class of planters recognized
the sincere efforts of the Freedmen’s Bureau to aid them, and
to organize a labor system which should prove beneficial to
both employers and employed. They generally spoke of its
officers with respect; and many acknowledged that it would
be a great injury to the country to have it immediately removed.
Others were bitter in their opposition to it; and I
often heard such remarks as this: “The idea of a <em>nigger</em> having
the power of bringing a <em>white man</em> before a tribunal! The
Southern people a’n’t going to stand that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The negro of Middle Georgia is a creature in whom the
emotions entirely predominate over the intellectual faculties.
He has little of that shrewdness which town life cultivates in
the black race. The agents of the Bureau complained that
they had sometimes great difficulty in persuading him to act
in accordance with his own interests. If a stranger offered
him twelve dollars a month, and a former master in whom he
had confidence, appealing to his gratitude and affection, offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>him one dollar, he would exclaim impulsively, “I work
for you, Mass’r Will!” Sometimes, when he had been induced
by his friends to enter a complaint against his master
or mistress for wrongs done him, ludicrous and embarrassing
scenes occurred in the freedmen’s courts. “Now, Thomas,”
says the good lady, “can you have the heart to speak a word
against your old, dear, kind mistress?” “No, missus, I neber
will!” blubbers Thomas; and that is all the court can get out
of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reverence shown by the colored people toward the
officers of the Bureau was often amusing. They looked to
them for what they had formerly depended upon their masters
for. If they had lost a pig, they seemed to think such
great and all-powerful men could find it for them without any
trouble. They cheered them in the streets, and paid them at
all times the most abject respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was told that the blacks were quite as apt to keep their
contracts as the whites; and that often, when they broke
them, it was through the persuasion of some planter who
lacked laborers. “Look here, Sam, I’m giving two dollars
a month more than this man you are at work for; why don’t
you come and live with me?” A respectable planter was
fined a hundred and fifty dollars for this offence, by the Bureau,
whilst I was at Macon. “It is one of the worst offences
we have to deal with,” said Colonel Lambert, “and one that
we punish most severely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the popular belief that the agents of the Bureau had
control of funds arising from such fines, and that they appropriated
them pretty freely to their own use. On the contrary,
they were required at the end of each month to make returns
and forward all funds on hand to the chief quartermaster of
the State, who alone was authorized to apply them in necessary
expenditures.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were four freedmen’s schools in Macon, with eleven
teachers and a thousand pupils. There was a night-school of
two hundred children and adults, where I saw men of my own
age learning their letters, (and thought, “What if <em>I</em> was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>first learning <em>my</em> letters?”) and gray-haired old men and
women forming, with slowness and difficulty, by the aid of
spectacles, the first characters in the writing-book. The
teachers were furnished by the American Missionary Association,—the
freedmen paying for their own books, (an item
with the booksellers,) and for the necessary fuel and lights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Eddy, the superintendent, and an old experienced
teacher, said to me: “The children of these schools have
made in a given time more progress in the ordinary branches
of education than any white schools I ever taught. In mathematics
and the higher sciences they are not so forward.
The eagerness of the older ones to learn is a continual wonder
to me. The men and women say, ‘We work all day, but we’ll
come to you in the evening for learning, and we want you to
make us learn; we’re dull, but we want you to beat it into
us!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was much interested in a class of young clergymen who
recited in the evening to the young matron of the “teachers’
home.” One of them told me with tears of gratitude how
kind and faithful all the teachers had been to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you not mistaken?” I said. “I have been told a
hundred times that the Southern people are your best friends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He replied: “Georgia passed a law making it a penitentiary
offence, punishable with five years’ imprisonment, to
teach a slave to read. Now we are no longer slaves, and we
are learning to read. They may deceive you, but <em>we</em> know
who are our best friends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was repeatedly assured by earnest secessionists that there
were no Union men in Georgia; that, soon or late, all went
into the rebellion. But one day I met an old man who denied
the charge with indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sixty-five years old. I fought for the spot where
Macon now stands, when it was Indian territory. I don’t
know what they mean by no Union men. If to fight against
secession from first to last, and to oppose the war in every
way, makes a Union man, I was that. Of course I paid
taxes, because I couldn’t help it. And when Stoneman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>raided on us, and every man that could bear arms was pressed,
I went with the rest, and was all day behind the breastworks.
But I’ve always spoke my mind, and being an old citizen, I
never got hung yet. A majority of the people of Macon were
with me, if they had only dared to say so. They hate the
secessionists now worse than they hate the Yankees: no comparison!
The secessionists now cry, ‘No party!’ but never
a party stuck together closer than they do.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Confederates,” he went on, “injured us ten times
more than the Yankees did. When Wilson came in last
April, he put a guard at my house, who stayed with me seven
weeks, and did his duty faithfully.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXV.<br /> <span class='large'>ANDERSONVILLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Just across the railroad track below Macon, in a pleasant
pine grove, is the Fair Ground, where was located that thing
of misery known to us as the Macon Prison. It was the
“Yankee Prison,” down here.</p>

<p class='c000'>I visited the spot one bright morning after a shower, when
the breezes and the sunshine were in the pine-tops overhead.
The ground was covered with a thin growth of brown grass,
wet with the rain: stepping along which I came suddenly to
a quadrangular space, as arid as the hill of Golgotha. No
marks were necessary to show where the stockade had stood,
with its elevated scaffolding on which walked the Rebel guard.
The stockade had been removed; but the blasted and barren
earth remained to testify of the homesick feet that had trodden
it into dreary sterility.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little stream runs through a hollow below the Fair
Ground, carrying off much of the filth of the town. From
that stream our prisoners drank. The tub set in the side of
the bank at the foot of the hill, and the ditch that conducted
into it the water for their use, were still there. Guarded,
they came down from the stockade, to this tub, of the contents
of which they were not always permitted to have enough.
“I used to hear ’em yell for water,” said a negro living near.
“I was bad off as a slave, but I never begun to be so bad off
as they was. Some of ’em had no shoes for winter, and almost
no clothes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the pine woods on the hill above the area of the stockade
is “Death’s Acre,”—the prison burying-ground, enclosed
by a plain board fence, and containing little rows of humble
graves marked with stakes, and numbered. I noticed numbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>as high as two hundred and thirty. How many national
soldiers lie buried in this lot I do not know.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall not dwell upon the sufferings endured by the inmates
of this prison. They shrink into insignificance compared with
the horrors of the great military prison of Georgia and the
South. Neither of these do I purpose to say much. Enough,
and more than enough has been spoken and written about
them. The infamy of Andersonville is world-wide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing through Washington in August, 1865, I one morning
looked into the hot and steaming court-room where Captain
Henry Wirz was on trial. In a somewhat worn broadcloth
coat, with his counsel at his side occasionally whispering
him, his elbow on a table, and his thin uneasy hand fingering
his dark beard or supporting his chin; attenuated, bent, and
harassed with the most terrible anxieties,—for, however indifferent
he may have been to the lives of other and better
men, there was one life to which he was not indifferent, and
which was now at stake; down-looking for the most part,
but frequently glancing his quick sharp eye at the court
or the witnesses; there sat the miserable man, listening to
minutely detailed accounts of the atrocities of which he had
been the instrument. The cause he had served with such
savage fidelity, had perished; and the original authors of the
enormities he had been employed to commit, stalked at large,
or lay in temporary confinement, confidently expecting the
executive clemency; while this wretched hireling, whose sin
consisted in having done their work too well, was to suffer,
not the just for the unjust, but the guilty dog for the still
more guilty masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fifty-eight miles below Macon, by the South-western Railroad,
is the scene of the crimes against humanity for which
Henry Wirz was punished with death. The place is set down
as <em>Anderson</em> on maps and in guide-books; and that is the
name by which it was known to the inhabitants of the country,
until the immense hideous business the war brought to it
dignified it with the title of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ville</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a disagreeable town, with absolutely no point of interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>about it except the prison. Before the war it had but five
buildings: a church without a steeple; a small railroad depot;
a little framed box in which was the country post-office; and
two dwellings,—a log-cabin, and a house with a saw- and
grist-mill attached. There were other dwellings within a mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was Anderson. Anderson<em>ville</em> contains some forty
additional cheap-looking, unpainted buildings, of various sizes,
all of which were constructed with reference to the prison;
such as officers’ houses, large or small according to the rank
of the occupants, government storehouses, hospital buildings,
(for the troops on duty,) and so forth. The hospital is now
used as a hotel. The entire aspect and atmosphere of the
place are ugly and repulsive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The village lies on the railroad and west of it. Between a
third and one half of a mile east of it, is the prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>The space enclosed by the rough stockade contains twenty-five
acres, divided by a sluggish stream flowing through it. It
looks like a great horse-yard. Much of the land is swampy,
but the rest is elevated, rising on the south side gradually,
and on the north side quite steeply from the brook. It was
from this shallow stream, defiled with refuse from the camp of
the Georgia Reserves, which it received before entering the
stockade, that the thirty thousand prisoners, who were sometimes
crowded into this broken oblong space, drew their chief
supply of water. There were a few little springs in the banks,
very precious to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of the stockade are of upright logs about a foot
in diameter, twenty feet high above the ground, in which they
are set close together, deep enough to be kept firmly in their
position. There are an outer and an inner wall of this description,
with a space some fifty yards in breadth between
them. There were sentry-boxes for the soldiers on guard,
hung like birds’-nests near the top of the inner wall. These
were reached by ladders. For further security, the stockade
was partly surrounded by a deep ditch; and on portions of
two sides there is an unfinished third line of upright logs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The outer wall of the stockade has but one entrance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>Through this the newly arrived prisoners were marched, and
along the space between the two walls, to one of two gates
which gave admission to the interior of the prison. How
many thousands of brave and stalwart soldiers entered these
infernal doors, from which only ghostly skeleton-men, or the
corpses of skeleton-men, ever issued forth again!</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners were of course confined within the inner
wall. And not only so, but they were prevented from approaching
within twenty feet of it by the dead line. Or if
not prevented,—for much of the way this fatal boundary was
marked only by posts set at intervals of six or seven yards,—he
who, in blindness and sickness and despair, perhaps jostled
out of his way by the blind, sick, despairing multitude crowded
within, set his foot one inch beyond the strict limits, as some
Rebel on guard chose to <em>imagine</em> them, crack-went a musket,
a light puff of smoke curled up from one of the birds’-nests,
and the poor wretch lay in his blood, groaning out the last of
many groans, which ended his long misery.</p>

<p class='c000'>I learned that when the stockade was first built the ground
it encloses was covered with forest-trees. Why were they not
left—at least a few of them—to bless with their cooling
shade the unfortunate captives, in the heat of those terrible
prison summers? Not a tree remained. Near by were forests
of beautiful timber, to which they were not even permitted
to go and cut wood for fuel and huts.</p>

<p class='c000'>One can imagine nothing more dreary and disheartening
than the interior view of the stockade as it is to-day, except
the stockade as it was during the war. The holes in which
the prisoners burrowed for protection from the weather, have
been mostly destroyed by the washing rains. Nearly all the
huts are in ruins. The barrack sheds, in which but a mere
handful of the thirty thousand prisoners could find place, still
remain, marked with sad relics,—bunks with the names of
the occupants cut upon them, or fragments of benches, knives,
old pipes, and old shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the outer and inner walls were the bakehouse,
the pen for sick-call, and the log-sheds in which the stocks
were kept. The cookhouse was outside.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>Besides the great stockade, there was a small stockade for
officers, and a hospital stockade containing some eight acres,
and surrounded by upright logs ten or twelve feet high.</p>

<p class='c000'>In pleasant pine woods, about a hundred rods north of the
stockade, is the original burying-ground of the Andersonville
prison, enlarged and converted into a national cemetery since
the war. A whitewashed picket-fence encloses a square space
of near fifty acres, divided into four main sections by two avenues
crossing it and cutting each other at right angles. Two
of these sections—those south of the east-and-west road—are
subdivided by alleys into five smaller sections, where the dead
lie in long, silent rows, by hundreds. Here are about seven
thousand graves. The northeast quarter of the cemetery is
undivided; and here, in a single vast encampment, sleep five
thousand men. There are in all near thirteen thousand graves,
each with its little white head-board commemorating the name,
rank, company, regiment, and date of death, of its inmate.
The records show that the first death occurred on February
27th, 1864, and the last on April 28th, 1865. From April
1st, 1864, to April 1st, 1865, the average rate of mortality
was over a thousand a month. It sometimes reached a hundred
a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apart from the rest, in the northwestern corner of the cemetery,
are the graves of the Georgia Reserves who died while
on duty here,—one hundred and fifteen out of four regiments.
The mortality among them appears also to have been great;
and indeed one cannot conceive how it should be otherwise,
living as they did within the pestiferous influence of the prison
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the entrance to the cemetery, on the south side, appears
the following inscription,—the same I noticed above the
graves at Spottsylvania, and which might with propriety be
placed before every national soldiers’ cemetery:—</p>

<p class='c000'>At the intersection of the avenues rises the flag-staff planted

Nation’s power and victory; while all round this sanctified
ground stand the ancient pines, Nature’s serene and solemn
priesthood, waving their green arms, and murmuring softly,

mother! O wife! art mourning in thy desolated Northern
home,—the requiems of the weary ones at rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rebel owner of the land occupied by the prison had
been pardoned by the President; and I learned of the Freedmen’s
Bureau that he had asked for the restoration of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>property,—demanding even that the cemetery grounds should
be turned over to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion I may state that citizens of Georgia, living at
a distance from Andersonville, said to me that they knew of
the atrocities permitted there at the time of their occurrence,
and that they did not think it possible for the Rebel leaders to
have been ignorant of them.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>SHERMAN IN MIDDLE GEORGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>According to a tradition which I found current in Middle
Georgia, General Sherman remarked, while on his grand
march through the State, that he had his gloves on as yet, but
that he should take them off in South Carolina. Afterwards,
in North Carolina, I heard the counterpart of this story. As
soon as he had crossed the State line, “Boys,” said he to his
soldiers, “remember we are in the old North State now;”
which was equivalent to putting his gloves on again.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the mere mention of these anecdotes, however, many good
Georgians and North Carolinians blazed up with indignation:
“If he had his gloves on here, I should like to know what he
did with his gloves off!”—and it was not easy to convince
them that they had suffered less than their neighbors in South
Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Confederate brigadier-general said to me: “One could
track the line of Sherman’s march all through Georgia and
South Carolina by the fires on the horizon. He burned the gin-houses,
cotton-presses, railroad depots, bridges, freight-houses,
and unoccupied dwellings, with some that were occupied. He
stripped our people of everything. He deserves to be called
the Great Robber of the nineteenth century. He did a sort
of retail business in North Carolina, but it was a wholesale
business, and no mistake, in Georgia, though perhaps not quite
so smashing as his South Carolina operations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Confederate soldiers delight in criticisms and anecdotes of
this famous campaign. Here are two or three samples.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When we were retreating before old Sherman, he sent
word to Johnston that he wished he would leave just a horseshoe,
or something to show where he had been. Hood always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>left enough; but Johnston licked the ground clean behind
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Didn’t we have high old times laying in the water, nights
when we had a chance to lay down at all! I remember, one
of our boys was told he must move his position, one night,
after we’d just got comfortably settled down in the wet. Says
he, ‘I’ve got my water hot, and I be d——d if I’m going
to move for anybody!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The approach to Savannah was defended by splendid,
proud forts, bristling with long old cannon, and our cowardly
militia just run from them without firing a shot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You should have seen Washington’s statue, at Columbia,
after Sherman burned the city! Nose broke, eyes bunged,
face black and blue, and damaged miscellaneously, the Father
of his Country looked like he’d been to an Irish wedding.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The citizens talked with equal freedom, but with less hilarity,
of the doings of the “Great Robber.” A gentleman of
Jones County said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had a noble field of corn, not yet harvested. Old Sherman
came along, and turned his droves of cattle right into it,
and in the morning there was no more corn there than there
is on the back of my hand. His devils robbed me of all my
flour and bacon and corn meal. They took all the pillow-slips,
ladies’ dresses, drawers, chemises, sheets, and bed-quilts,
they could find in the house, to tie up their plunder in. You
couldn’t hide anything but they’d find it. I sunk a cask of
molasses in a hog-wallow; that I think I should have saved,
but a nigger boy the rascals had with ’em said he ’lowed there
was something hid there; so he went to feeling with a stick,
and found the molasses. Then they just robbed my house of
every pail, cup, dish, what-not, that they could carry molasses
off to their camping-ground in. After they’d broke open the
cask, and took what they wanted, they left the rest to run in
a river along the ground. There was one sweet hog-wallow,
if there never was another!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A lady, living near Milledgeville, was the president of a
soldiers’ aid society. At the time of Sherman’s visit she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>in her house a dry-goods box full of stockings knit by the fair
hands of patriotic ladies for the feet of the brave defenders of
their country. This box she caused to be buried in a field
which was afterwards ploughed, in order to obliterate all
marks of its concealment. A squadron of cavalry arriving at
this field, formed in line, charged over it, and discovered the
box by a hollow sound it gave forth under the hoofs of the
horses. The box was straightway brought to light, to the joy
of many a stockingless invader, who had the fair ladies of
Milledgeville to thank for his warm feet that winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees took special delight in killing dogs, many an
innocent cur having to atone with his life for the sins committed
by bloodhounds used in hunting down negroes, conscripts,
and escaped Yankee prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman’s field-orders show that it was not his intention to
permit indiscriminate destruction and plundering.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Yet these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>orders appear to have been interpreted by his men very liberally.
A regiment, was usually sent ahead with instructions to
guard private dwellings; but as soon as the guards were removed,
a legion of stragglers and negroes rushed in to pillage;
and I am convinced that in some cases even the guards
pilfered industriously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilson’s men, when they seized fresh horses for their use,
turned the jaded ones loose in the country. Sherman’s army-corps
acted on a different principle. The deliberate aim
seemed to be to <em>leave no stock whatever in the line of march</em>.
Whenever fresh horses were taken, the used-up animals
were shot. Such also was the fate of horses and mules found
in the country, and not deemed worth taking. The best herds
of cattle were driven off; inferior herds were slaughtered in
the fields, and left. A company of soldiers would shoot down
a drove of hogs, cut out the hind-quarters, and abandon what
remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Federal army generally behaved very well in this
State,” said a Confederate officer. “I don’t think there was
ever an army in the world that would have behaved better, on
a similar expedition, in an enemy’s country. Our army certainly
wouldn’t. The destruction of railroads, mills, and gin-houses,
if designed to cripple us, was perfectly justifiable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you did have as mean a set of stragglers following
your army as ever broke jail. I’ll do you the credit to say,
though, that there were more foreigners than Yankees among
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A lot of these rascals came to my house, and just about
turned it inside out. They wouldn’t wait for my wife to give
them the keys of the bureau, but smashed in the drawers
with the butts of their muskets, and emptied them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My sister, living near me, gave her plate and valuables,
locked up in a trunk, to a negro, who took it and hid it in the
woods. Then, to avoid suspicion, he joined the Yankees, and
was gone with ’em several days. She felt great anxiety about
the trunk, until one morning he came home, by the way of
the woods, grinning, with the trunk on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>“My wife did like my sister. She gave her money and
plate to a negro, who hid it; but he didn’t get off so well as
the other darkey. The Yankees suspected him, and threatened
to hang him if he didn’t give it up. They got the rope
around his neck, and actually did string him up, till they found
he would die sooner than tell, when they let him down again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your fellows hung several men in my neighborhood, to
make ’em tell where their money was. Some gave it up after
a little hanging; but I know one man who went to the limb
three times, and saved his money, and his life too. Another
man had three hundred dollars in gold hid in his garden.
He is very fat; weighs, I suppose, two hundred and fifty
pounds. He held out till they got the rope around his neck,
then he caved in. ‘I’m dogged,’ says he, ‘if I’m going to
risk my weight on a rope around my neck, just for a little
money!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>An old gentleman in Putnam County, near Eatonton, related
the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sherman’s men gave my son-in-law sut! He had made
that year thirty-two hundred gallons of syrup,—more than
he had casks for; so he sunk a tank in the ground, and buried
it. The Yankee soldiers all came and helped themselves to
it. He had the finest flower-garden in the country; they
made his own slaves scatter salt, and corn-on-the-cob, all over
it, then they turned their horses on, and finished it. They
made my own daughter wait on them at table. She said she
kept servants for such work; but they replied: ‘You are
none too good.’ They robbed all the houses through here of
all the jewels, watches, trinkets, and hard metals the people
didn’t put out of their way; and stripped us of our bedding
and clothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman’s invasion of the South cannot properly be called
a raid: even Wilson’s brilliant expedition with twelve thousand
cavalry is belittled by that epithet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman had under his command four infantry corps and a
corps of cavalry, pursuing different routes, their caterpillar
tracks sometimes crossing each other, braiding a belt of devastation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>from twenty-five to fifty miles in breadth, and upwards
of six hundred miles in extent. The flanking parties driving
the light-footed Rebel cavalry before them; bridges fired by
the fugitives; pontoon trains hurrying to the front of the advancing
columns, when streams were to be crossed; the hasty
corduroying of bad roads; the jubilant foraging parties sweeping
the surrounding country of whatever was needful to support
life and vigor in those immense crawling and bristling
creatures, called army-corps; the amazing quantity and variety
of plunder collected together on the routes of the wagon-trains,—the
soldiers sitting proudly on their heaped-up stores, as the
trains approached, then, in lively fashion, thrusting portions
into each wagon as it passed,—for no halt was allowed; the
ripping up of railroads, the burning and plundering of plantations;
the encampment at evening, the kindling of fires, the
sudden disappearance of fences, and the equally sudden springing
up of shelter-tents, like mushrooms, all over the ground;
the sleep of the vast, silent, guarded hosts; and the hilarious
awakening to the toil and adventures of a new day; such are
the scenes of this most momentous expedition, which painters,
historians, romancers, will in future ages labor to conceive and
portray.</p>

<p class='c000'>Warned by the flying cavalry, and the smoke and flames
of plantations on the horizon, the panic-stricken inhabitants
thought only of saving their property and their lives from the
invaders. Many fled from their homes, carrying with them
the most valuable of their possessions, or those which could be
most conveniently removed. Mules, horses, cattle, sheep,
hogs, were driven wildly across the country, avoiding one
foraging party perhaps only to fall into the hands of another.
The mother caught up her infant; the father, mounting,
took his terrified boy upon the back of his horse behind him;
the old man clutched his money-bag and ran; not even the
poultry, not even the dogs were forgotten; men and women
shouldering their household stuffs, and abandoning their houses
to the mercies of the soldiers, whose waving banners and
bright steel were already appearing on the distant hill-tops.</p>

<p>FLEEING BEFORE SHERMAN’S GRAND MARCH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>Such panic flights were often worse than useless. Woe unto
that house which was found entirely deserted! To the honor
of Southern housewives be it recorded, that the majority of
them remained to protect their homes, whilst their husbands
and slaves ran off the live stock from the plantations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flight from Milledgeville, including the stampede of the
Rebel State legislators, who barely escaped being entrapped
by our army,—the crushing of passengers and private effects
into the overloaded cars, the demand for wheeled vehicles, and
the exorbitant prices paid for them, the fright, the confusion,
the separation of families,—formed a scene which neither the
spectators nor the actors in it will soon forget.</p>

<p class='c000'>The negroes had all along been told that if they fell into
the hands of the Yankees they would be worked to death on
fortifications, or put into the front of the battle and shot if
they did not fight, or sent to Cuba and sold; and that the old
women and young children would be drowned like cats and
blind puppies. And now the masters showed their affection for
these servants by running off the able-bodied ones, who were
competent to take care of themselves, and leaving the aged,
the infirm, and the children, to the “cruelties” of the invaders.
The manner in which the great mass of the remaining negro
population received the Yankees, showed how little they had
been imposed upon by such stories, and how true and strong
their faith was in the armed deliverance which Providence
had ordained for their race.</p>

<p class='c000'>“IV. The army will <em>forage liberally on the country during the march</em>. To this end,
each brigade commander will organize a good and sufficient foraging party, under
the command of one or more discreet officers, who will gather near the route travelled
corn or forage of any kind, meat of any kind, vegetables or corn-meal or whatever
is needed by the command; aiming at all times to keep in the wagon trains <em>at
least ten days’ provisions for the command, and three days’ forage. Soldiers must not
enter the dwellings</em> of the inhabitants, or commit any trespass during the halt or a
camp; they may be permitted to gather turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables, and
drive in stock in front of their camps. To regular foraging parties must be intrusted
the gathering of provisions and forage at any distance from the road travelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“V. To army-corps commanders is intrusted the power <em>to destroy mills, houses,
cotton-gins, &amp;c.</em>, and for them this general principle is laid down: In districts and
neighborhoods <em>where the army is unmolested no destruction</em> of such property should
be permitted; but should guerillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the
inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then
army-corps commanders should order and <em>enforce a devastation more or less relentless
according to the measure of such hostility</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“VI. As for horses, mules, wagons, &amp;c., belonging to the inhabitants, the cavalry
and artillery may appropriate freely and without limit, discriminating, however, between
the rich, who are usually hostile, and the poor or industrious, usually neutral
or friendly. Foraging parties may also take mules or horses to replace the jaded
animals of their trains, or to serve as pack-mules for the regiments or brigades. In
all foraging, of whatever kind, the parties engaged will refrain from abusive or
threatening language, and may, when the officer in command thinks proper, give
written certificates of the facts, but no receipts; and they will endeavor to leave with
each family a reasonable portion for their maintenance.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>PLANTATION GLIMPSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In travelling through the South one sees many plantations
ruined for some years to come by improper cultivation. The
land generally washes badly, and where the hill-sides have
been furrowed up and down, instead of being properly “horizontalized,”
the rains plough them into gulleys, and carry off
the cream of the soil. Or perhaps neglect, during four years
of war, has led to the same result. Many worn-out plantations
are in this condition, the gulleys cutting the slopes into
ridges and chasms.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Georgia, as in parts of Alabama, one becomes weary of
tracts of poor-looking country, overgrown with sedge-grass,
or covered with oaks and pines. The roads, never good, in
bad weather are frightful. Never a church steeple relieves
the monotony of the landscape. Occasionally there is a village,
its houses appearing to be built upon props. If standing
upon a ridge above the highway or railroad by which you
pass, the sight of the blue sky <em>under</em> them gives them a singular
appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is customary, all through the South, to build country-houses
in this manner, and rarely with cellars. The props,
which are sometimes of brick, but oftener of fat pine, which
makes an underpinning almost as durable as brick, lift the building
a few feet from the earth and allow a free circulation of air
under it. This peculiarity, which strikes a stranger as unnecessary,
is not so. A Northern man of my acquaintance, settled
in North Carolina, told me that he built his house in the
New-England style, with a close underpinning; but soon discovered
that the dampness of the earth was causing the lower
timbers to rot badly. By opening the underpinning, and ventilating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>the foundation, he succeeded in checking the decay.
Let Northern men emigrating to the South take a hint from
his experience. No doubt many Southern customs, which
appear to us irrational or useless, will thus be found to have
originated in common sense and necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was too late to see the cotton-picking, and too early for
the chopping-out and hoeing, but in season to witness the
preparation of the ground for planting. Sometimes, in a gang
of fifty or sixty laborers running as many ploughs on the fields
of a large plantation, there would be twenty or thirty women
and strong girls. The sight of so many ploughs in motion,
each drawn by a single mule, and scratching its narrow furrow
three inches deep, was of itself interesting; and the presence
with the ploughmen of the stout black ploughwomen added to
it a certain picturesqueness.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already related how my ignorance was enlightened
with regard to the manufacture of ploughs on Alabama plantations.
I afterwards saw the blacksmiths at work upon these
somewhat rude implements, and learned that some of the larger
plantations manufactured their own carts and wagons. The
plantation harness is a simple affair, and is nearly always made
on the place. While the negro women are spinning and weaving
cloth in rainy-weather, the men are bending hames, braiding
mule-collars of corn husks, and making back-bands of leather
or bagging.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found that some of the large plantations had, besides a
white superintendent, two black overseers,—one whose sole
business was to take care of the ploughs and hoes, and one
who looked after the mules and other live stock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The buildings of a first-class plantation form a little village
by themselves. There is first the planter’s house, which is
commonly a framed dwelling of good size, with two or four
brick chimneys built outside. There is not a closet in the
house. The pantry and dairy form a separate building. The
kitchen is another; and the meat-house still another. Next
in importance to the planter’s house is the overseer’s house.
Then come the negro quarters, which, on some plantations I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>have seen, are very comfortable and neat-looking little framed
houses. They are oftener mere huts. A barn is a rare exception.
The corn is kept in cribs, and other grain in out-door
bins framed with roof-like covers that shut down and lock.
Then there are the mule-pens; the gin-house (if it has not
been burned); and the mill for crushing sorghum. Orchards
are rare, planters thinking of little besides cotton, and living,
like their negroes, chiefly on hog and hominy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Travelling by private conveyance from Eatonton—the
northern terminus of the Milledgeville and Eatonton Railroad—over
to Madison on the Georgia road, on my way to
Augusta, I passed a night at a planter’s house of the middle
class. It was a plain, one-and-a-half story, unpainted, weather-browned
framed dwelling, with a porch in front, and two front
windows. The oaken floors were carpetless, but clean swept.
The rooms were not done off at all; there was not a lath, nor
any appearance of plastering or whitewash about them. The
rafters and shingles of the roof formed the ceiling of the garret-chamber;
the sleepers and boards of the chamber-floor,
the ceiling of the sitting-room; and the undisguised beams,
studs, and clapboards of the frame and its covering, composed
the walls. The dining-room was a little detached framed box,
without a fireplace, and with a single broken window. There
was a cupboard, a wardrobe, and a bed in the sitting-room; a
little bedroom leading off from it; and two beds in the garret.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a glowing fire in the fireplace, beside which sat
a neatly-attired, fine-looking, but remarkably silent grandmother,
taking snuff, or smoking.</p>

<p class='c000'>The house had three other inmates,—the planter and his
wife, and their son, a well-educated young man, who sat in
the evening reading “Handy Andy” by the light of pitch-pine
chips thrown at intervals upon the oak-wood fire. No
candle was lighted except for me, at bedtime.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, be it understood, was not the house of a small farmer,
but of the owner of two plantations, of a thousand acres each.
He had fifty-nine negroes before the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a branch running through his estate, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>bottom-land of which he could make a bale of cotton to the
acre. On the uplands it took three or four acres to make a
bale. This year his son had undertaken to run the plantation
we were on, while he was to oversee the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man was far more hopeful of success than his
father.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old man said: “You can’t get anything out of the
niggers, now they’re free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never knew them to work any better,” said the young
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just now they are showing a little spirit, maybe,” said
the father; “but it won’t continue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe mine will do more work this year than ever,”
said the son.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps they will for you, but they won’t for me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The old man went away early in the evening to spend the
night on his other plantation. After he was gone, the young
man looked up from the pages of “Handy Andy,” and remarked
emphatically:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The great trouble in this country is, the people are mad
at the niggers because they’re free. They always believed
they wouldn’t do well if they were emancipated, and now
they maintain, and some of them even hope, they won’t do
well,—that too in the face of actual facts. The old planters
have no confidence in the niggers, and as a matter of course
the niggers have no confidence in them. They have a heap
more confidence in their young masters, and they work well
for us. They have still more confidence in the Yankees, and
they work still better for them. They have the greatest affection
for the Yankees; they won’t steal from them, like they
will from us. I had forty-seven hogs in one lot when I took
the plantation; and in two weeks there were only twenty-six
left. The same thing happened to my turnip patch. I don’t
reckon it is my freedmen that steal from me; but the country
is full of thieving darkeys that think it’s no wrong to take
from a Southern white man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish we older ones had the faculty you say you have for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>making the free niggers work,” said the young man’s mother.
“I always kept two women just to weave. The same women
are with me now. Before they were declared free, they could
weave six and eight yards of cloth a day, easy. Now the
most they do is about one yard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The house was on the main road traversed by the 15th
corps, belonging to the left wing of Sherman’s army, on its
way from Madison to Milledgeville.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never would have thought I could stay home while the
Yankees were passing,” said the young man’s mother, “but I
did. They commenced passing early in the morning, and
there wasn’t an hour in the day that they were not as thick,
as blue pigeons along the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was very much excited at first. My husband was away,
and I had nobody with me but our negroes. A German soldier
came into the house first of any. He was an ugly-looking
fellow as ever I saw; but I suppose any man would have
looked ugly to me under such circumstances. Said he, ‘I’ve
orders to get a saddle from this house.’ I told him my husband
had done gone off with the only saddle we had. Then
he said, ‘A pistol will do.’ I said I had no pistol. Then he
told me he must have a watch of me. I had a watch, but it
was put out of the way where I hoped no Yankee could find
it; so I told him I had none for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He then looked all around the room, and said, ‘Madam,
I have orders to burn this house.’ I replied that I hoped the
Federals were too magnanimous to burn houses over the heads
of defenceless women. He said, ‘I’ll insure it for fifty dollars;’
for that’s the way they got a heap of money out of
our people. I said, ‘I’ve no fifty dollars to pay for insuring
it; and if it depends upon that, it must burn.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Soon as he saw he couldn’t frighten me into giving him
anything, he went to plundering. He had found a purse, with
five dollars in Confederate money in it, when he saw an officer
coming into the front door, and escaped through the back
door. He was a very great villain, and the officer said if he
was caught he would be punished.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>“I don’t know what I should have done if it hadn’t been
for the Yankee officers. They treated me politely in every
way. They couldn’t prevent my meal and bacon from being
taken by the foraging parties,—all except what I had hid;
but they gave me a guard to keep soldiers from plundering
the house, and when one guard was taken away I had another
in his place. Some families on this road, who had no guard,
were so broken up they had nothing left to keep house with.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When the foragers were carrying off our provisions, I
said to an officer, ‘That’s all the corn meal I have,’—which
wasn’t quite true, for I had some hid away; but he ordered
the men to return me a sack. I didn’t make anything by the
lie; for the next party that came along took the sack the
others had left. But I did save a pot of lard. I said to an
officer, ‘They’ve done taken all my turkeys and cows and
hogs, and you will leave me without anything.’ ‘Take back
that pot of lard to the lady,’ said he; and I soon had it where
it wasn’t seen again that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What was out doors nothing could prevent the soldiers
from taking. I had bee-gum, and they just carried it off,
hives and all. A soldier would catch up a hive, and march
right along, with it on his head, and with the bees swarming
all about him. They didn’t care anything for the bees. I
reckon they wouldn’t sting Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c000'>During the evening, I paid a visit to the freedmen’s quarters.
The doors of the huts were all open, in a row, and I
could see a dozen negro families grouped around cheerful fires
within, basking in the yellow light, and looking quite happy
and comfortable.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>POLITICS AND FREE LABOR IN GEORGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At Milledgeville,—a mere village (of twenty-five hundred
inhabitants before the war), surrounded by a beautiful hilly
and wooded country,—I saw something of the Georgia State
Legislature. It was at work on a cumbersome and rather
useless freedmen’s code, which, however, contained no very
objectionable features. In intelligence and political views this
body represented the State very fairly. I was told that its
members, like the inhabitants of the State at large, were, with
scarce an exception, believers in the right of secession. The
only questions that ever divided them on that subject, were
not as to the right, but as to the policy; and whether the State
should secede separately, or coöperate with the other seceding
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the Rebel State debt had been repudiated, there
existed a feeling among both legislators and people that all
debts, public and private, ought to be wiped out with it. I
remember well the argument of a gentleman of Morgan
County. “Two thirds of the people in this county are left
hopelessly involved by the loss of the war debt. There is a
law to imprison a man for paying what the act of the convention
takes from him the power of paying. The more loyal
portion of our citizens would not invest in Confederate scrip,
but put their money into State bonds, which they thought safe
from repudiation. A large number of debts are for negro
property. Now, since slavery is abolished, all debts growing
out of slavery ought to be abolished. Four or five men in this
county,” he added, “have the power to ruin over thirty
families, whose obligations they bought up with Confederate
money. As that money turns out to have never been legally
good for anything, all such obligations should be cancelled.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>Throughout the State I heard the bitterest complaints against
the Davis despotism. “There was first a tax of ten per cent.
levied on all our produce; then of twelve per cent. on all
property. Worse still, our property was seized at the will of
the government, and scrip given in exchange, which was not
good for taxes or anything else. There was public robbery
by the government, and private robbery by the officers of the
government. The Secretary of War, Seddon, had grain to
sell; so he raised the price of it to forty dollars a bushel, when
it should have sold for two dollars and a half. The conscript
act was executed with the most criminal partiality. A man
of an influential family had no difficulty in evading it. During
the last year of the war, there were one hundred and twenty-two
thousand young Confederates in bomb-proof situations.
But an ordinary conscript was treated like a prisoner, thrown
into jail, and often handcuffed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of slave property was the subject of endless debate.
Said a Georgia planter: “I owned a hundred niggers;
their increase paid me eight per cent., their labor four per
cent.; and I’ve sixty thousand dollars’ worth of property
buried in that lot,”—pointing to the plantation graveyard.
The convention that reconstructed the State had not the grace
to accept emancipation without inserting in the new Bill of
Rights the proviso “that this acquiescence in the action of
the United States Government is not intended as a relinquishment,
or waiver or estoppel of such claim for compensation of
loss sustained by reason of the emancipation of his slaves as
any citizen of Georgia may hereafter make upon the justice
and magnanimity of that government.” And there existed in
most minds a growing hope that, when the Southern representatives
got into Congress, measures would be carried, compelling
the government not only to pay for slaves, but for all
other losses occasioned by the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not one of the men elected as members of Congress could
take the Congressional test-oath. The mere fact that a man
could take that oath was sufficient to insure his defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Georgia has no common-school system. The poor, who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>show that they are unable to pay for the tuition of their
children, are permitted to send them to private schools on the
credit of the county in which they reside. Few, however,
take advantage of a privilege which involves a confession of
poverty. There is great need of Northern benevolent effort
to bring forward the education of the poor whites in all these
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the freedmen’s schools in Georgia supported by the
New-England Freedmen’s Aid Society, and the American
Missionary Association. These were confined to a few localities,—principally
to the large towns. There were sixty-two
schools, with eighty-nine teachers, and six thousand six hundred
pupils. There were in other places, self-supporting schools,
taught by colored teachers, who did not report to the State Superintendent.
The opposition to the freedmen’s schools, on the
part of the whites, was generally bitter; and in several counties
school-houses had been burned, and the teachers driven away,
on the withdrawal of the troops. Occasionally, however, I
would hear an intelligent planter make use of a remark like
this: “The South has been guilty of the greatest inconsistency
in the world, in sending missionaries to enlighten the heathen,
and forbidding the education of our own servants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At Augusta, I visited a number of colored schools; among
others, a private one kept by Mr. Baird, a colored man, in a
little room where he had secretly taught thirty pupils during
the war. The building, containing a store below and tenements
above, was owned and occupied by persons of his own
race; the children entered it by different doors, the girls with
their books strapped under their skirts, the boys with theirs
concealed under their coats; all finding their way in due season
to the little school-room. I was shown the doors and passages
by which they used to escape and disperse, at the approach
of white persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Baird told me that during ten years previous to the
War, he taught a similar school in the city of Charleston, South
Carolina. The laws prohibited persons of color from teaching;
and accordingly he employed a white woman to assist him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>She sat and sewed, and kept watch, until the patrol looked in,
when she appeared as the teacher, and the real teacher (a
small man) fell back as a pupil. It was ostensibly a school for
free colored children, the teaching of slaves to read being a
criminal offence; yet many of those were taught.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c000'>On the road to Augusta, my attention was attracted by the
conversation of two gentlemen, a Georgian and a Mississippian,
sitting behind me in the car.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had just passed Union Point, where there was considerable
excitement about an unknown negro found lying out in
the woods, sick with the small-pox. Nobody went to his relief,
and the citizens, standing with hands in their pockets, allowed
that, if he did not die of his disease, he would soon perish from
exposure and starvation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The trouble is just here,” said the Georgian behind me.
“The niggers have never been used to taking care of their
own sick. Formerly, if anything was the matter with them,
their masters had them taken care of; and now they don’t
mind anything about disease, except to be afraid of it. If
they’ve a sick baby, they let it die. They’re like so many
children themselves, in respect to sickness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How much better off they were when slaves!” said the
Mississippian. “A man would see to his own niggers, like
he would to his own stock. But the niggers now don’t belong
to anybody, and it’s no man’s business whether they live or
die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I exercise the same care over <em>my</em> niggers I always did,”
replied the Georgian. “They are all with me yet. Only one
ever left me. He was a good, faithful servant, but sickly. He
said one day he thought he ought to have wages, and I told
him if he could find anybody to do better by him than I was
doing, he’d better go. He went, and took his family; and
in six weeks he came back again. ‘Edward,’ I said, ‘how’s
this?’ ‘I want to come and live with you again, master, like
I always have,’ he said. ‘I find I ain’t strong enough to work
for wages.’ ‘Edward,’ I said, ‘I am very sorry; you wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>to go, and I got another man in your place; now I have
nothing for you to do, and your cabin is occupied.’ He just
burst into tears. ‘I’ve lived with you all my days, master,’
he said, ‘and now I have no home!’ I couldn’t stand that.
‘Take an ax,’ I said; ‘go into the woods, cut some poles, and
build you a cabin. As long as I have a home, you shall have
one.’ He was the happiest man you ever saw!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A Yankee wouldn’t have done that,” said the Mississippian.
“Yankees won’t take care of a poor white man. I’ve
travelled in the North, and seen people there go barefoot in
winter, with ice on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” said I, turning and facing the speaker. “What
State was that in?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the State of New York,” he replied. “I’ve seen hundreds
of poor whites barefoot there in the depth of winter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is singular,” I remarked. “I am a native of that
State; I lived in it until I was twenty years old, and have
travelled through it repeatedly since; and I never happened
to see what you describe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have seen the same thing in Massachusetts too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have been for some years a resident of Massachusetts,
and have never yet seen a man there barefoot in the snow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mississippian made no direct reply to this, but ran on
in a strain of vehement and venomous abuse of the Yankees,
in which he was cordially joined by his friend the Georgian.
Although not addressed to me, this talk was evidently intended
for my ear; but I had heard too much of the same sort everywhere
in the South to be disturbed by it. At length the conversation
turned upon the Freedmen’s Bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'>“General Tillson” (Assistant Commissioner for the State)
“has done a mighty mean thing!” said the Georgian. “I’ve
just made contracts to pay my freedmen seventy-five and a
hundred dollars a year. And now he is going to issue an
order requiring us to pay them a hundred and forty-four dollars.
That will ruin us. Down in South-western Georgia
they can afford to pay that; but in my county the land is so
poor we can’t feed our people at that rate. I’m going to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>Augusta now to see about it. If Tillson insists upon it, I
shall throw up my contracts: I can’t do it: I’ll sell out: I
won’t live in a country that’s ruled in this way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“From what county are you, sir?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oglethorpe; my name is C——. Are you an agent of
the Bureau?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir.” But from some remark I made, he got the impression
that I was connected with it. His abuse of the Yankees
ceased; and after a while he said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe General Tillson is a very fair man; and I understand
why he intends to issue such an order. To one planter
who is willing to do right by the freedmen, there are five that
will be unjust towards them. I wouldn’t accept the agency
of the Bureau in my county, because so many contracts have
been made that I couldn’t approve; and they would get me
into trouble with my neighbors. One man has hired a good
fair field hand, his wife, who is a good cook, his sister, a good
field hand, and his daughter, a good house servant, all for a
hundred dollars a year,—twenty-five dollars apiece; and he
doesn’t clothe them, either. That’s a specimen. I think
the Bureau ought to interfere in such cases. But it a’n’t
fair to make honest men suffer for the conduct of these sharpers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said I thought so too.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I hope you’ll tell General Tillson so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll tell him so, if you wish me to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And tell him you think I’m an honest man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am inclined to think you are an honest man, and I’ll
tell him that too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But see here: don’t mention what I said about the Yankees,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly not: that’s of no consequence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>C—— appeared quite anxious on that point. After serious
reflection, he said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you overheard me damn the Yankees, you’ll forgive
me, when I tell you how they treated me. It was after the
war was over, and that’s what made it hurt so. Seven of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Stoneman’s men came to my house, and put a carbine to my
breast, and demanded my watch. ‘You may shoot me,’ I
said, ‘but you can’t have my watch.’ ‘Then give us some
dinner,’ they said. I got dinner for them, and waited on them
with my own hands. They paid me for my trouble by stealing
seven of my horses. While I was absent from home,
trying to get back my horses, some more Yankees came and
robbed my house; they broke open the bureau with a chisel,
and injured more than they took. You don’t blame me for
cursing ’em, do you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not in the least. According to your story, they were very
great rascals.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After another interval of silence, C—— resumed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell General Tillson I am willing to pay my laborers
every dollar they’re worth: and that I treat them well. I’ve
one boy that has always been with me, and is a better overseer
than any white man I ever had. He looks after my interest
better than I can myself, for he is younger. I trust
everything in his hands,—all my keys, and sometimes
money.” He could not forbear adding,—“Your fanatics at
the North wouldn’t believe I treat this man so well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely. But it seems you have good reason for
treating him well. What do you pay him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I pay him two hundred dollars a year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what would you have to pay a white overseer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I couldn’t get a white man to do for me what he does, for
eight hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite sure,” I said, “that our fanatics at the North
would <em>not</em> see your extraordinary kindness to this man in the
same light you do. They would think him worth considerably
more than you pay him. If he does the work of a white
overseer, they would say he ought to have the salary of a
white overseer. They are such an unreasonable set, they
would consider six hundred dollars, the difference between his
wages and a white man’s, a pretty heavy tax to pay on the
color of his skin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>C—— did not seem inclined to pursue the subject, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>commenced talking in a very candid, sensible manner, of the
old Southern methods.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the war only breaks them up, it will have done some
good. Our large planters generally gave no attention to business.
The men were fast and reckless; the women, helpless
and luxurious. We gave so much attention to cotton and
niggers we couldn’t stop to think of the comforts of life. And
after all we were just working to enrich Northern capitalists.
There are no millionaires amongst us. Three hundred thousand
dollars is a rare and large fortune in Georgia.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Arriving in Augusta that night, I went the next morning
to call on General Tillson. In our conversation, I took early
occasion to speak to him of my yesterday’s acquaintance, Mr.
C——, of Oglethorpe County. “He will be here soon, and
explain to you why it is that planters in Northern Georgia
cannot afford to pay the twelve dollars a month you insist
upon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He will not be the first who has come to me on that business,”
replied the clear-headed general. “I shall give him a
patient hearing, and if he convinces me that I am wrong, he
will do more than any have done yet. When it was white
man against white man, these planters paid one hundred and
fifty and two hundred dollars a year for first-class field-hands.
Now they are not willing to pay the negro for his labor one
half what they formerly paid his owner. When I took charge
of the Bureau’s affairs in this State, last September, I found
the ordinary wages to be from two to seven dollars a month,—sometimes
as low as twelve bushels of corn for a year’s
labor. And the planters complained that the freedman wouldn’t
work for those prices. Now all I ask is that they should
pay what his labor is worth in the open market. Men from
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, say it is worth fifteen dollars,
and stand ready to give it. Since that is the case, to permit
him to make contracts for very much less, is to permit him to
be swindled. A little while ago many of these men were
wishing the negroes all driven out of the State; and now they
are in a great panic, because I am allowing them to go. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>come to me to remonstrate against sending off any more laborers.
‘Gentlemen,’ I say, ‘if you cannot afford to pay the
freedman what his services are worth, it is not his fault, but
your misfortune.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they <em>can</em> afford it. Here is a careful statement of
facts relating to free labor in Wilkes County, which adjoins
Oglethorpe. ‘One field-hand will cultivate nine acres of cotton,
on which he will raise three and a half bales, worth—say
three hundred and seventy-five dollars. The same hand
will also cultivate nine acres of corn, raising one hundred and
eight bushels, worth one hundred and eight dollars. Total,
four hundred and eighty-three dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Expenses:—Board, fifty-two dollars. Rent of cabin,
six. Fuel, six. Wages, one hundred forty-four. Total, two
hundred and eight dollars.’ Deducting two hundred and
eight from four hundred and eighty-three, you have a clear
profit of two hundred and seventy-five dollars on each man;
that, too, at the rate of wages I prescribe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These, understand, are the planters’ own estimates. In
South-western Georgia, where the land is much richer than in
this section, the most extravagant charges against the plantation
show a nett income of three hundred and twenty-five
dollars from the labor of a full field freedman. This estimate
is from data furnished by several of the most popular and
extensive planters in that region.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” added the Commissioner, “when your friend, Mr.
C——, of Oglethorpe, comes to make his complaint, if he is
the honest man you represent him to be, I will show him,
by his own figuring, that so far from being impoverished by
paying his men twelve dollars a month, he will make a handsome
profit from them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I went out, I found Mr. C——, of Oglethorpe, in the
ante-room, waiting to see the General. He regarded me with
a curious, uneasy expression, fearing no doubt lest I had
reported to the Commissioner his indiscreet remarks of yesterday
concerning the Yankees and the Bureau. I introduced
him to General Tillson, however, in a manner that seemed to
reassure him, and left them closeted together.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>That evening, by appointment, I saw the General at his
residence. “Well,” I asked, “how did you and my friend
C—— get along?” and received from him the following
statement, which he had kindly had copied for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here,” said General Tillson, “the profits of the labor are
placed as low, and the expenses as high, as Mr. C—— could
figure them, after considerable study. From the labor of a
hundred freedmen, on his two plantations, he would clear,
according to his own account, upwards of sixteen thousand
dollars,—sufficient to cover all risks, and all other expenses
of the plantation, and leave him a little fortune at the end of
the year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. C—— had repeated to General Tillson his statement
to me, regarding the dishonest contracts made with the freedmen
in his county. “The truth is,” said the General, “he
wants to hire them himself for about half what they are worth,
and he is indignant because others have hired them for less.
He can really afford to pay his help twice what I demand, and
then make two hundred dollars a year from the labor of each
freedman. The other day some leading planters from South-western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>Georgia made the same complaint with regard to
wages. ‘Very well,’ I said, ‘if you can’t pay twelve dollars
a month, give your laborers a part of the crops.’ They thought
one seventh of the cotton was more than they ought to give,
declaring that the negro would get rich on that. ‘If sixty
freedmen,’ I said, ‘can get rich on one seventh of a crop, the
planter, I am sure, can get rich on six sevenths.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The trouble is, these men wish to make everything there
is to be made, and leave the freedman nothing. They resort
to the meanest schemes to cheat him. They tell the negroes
that if they go with the agents of the Bureau to other places,
the able-bodied among them will be carried off and sold into
Cuba, and the women and children drowned in the Mississippi.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“I have not yet sent a thousand negroes out of the State,”
continued General Tillson. “But I have sent off enough to
alarm the people, and raise the rate of wages. I told the
planters on the coast of Georgia, that they must pay the
women twelve dollars a month, and the men fifteen, or I
would take the colored population out of their counties. That
brought them to terms, after all their talk about wanting to
get rid of the niggers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>“The freed people in most parts of the State are still so
ignorant of their condition, that they are glad to make contracts
to work for only their food and clothes. There are
many, however, who will live vagrant lives, if permitted. It
is necessary to compel such to enter into contracts.” Firmly
convinced of this necessity, General Tillson had issued an
order directing his agents to make contracts for all freedmen
without other means of support, who should neglect to make
contracts for themselves after a given time. The Commissioner
at Washington disapproved the order, for what reason
I cannot divine, unless it was feared that the over-zealous
friends of the negro at the North might be alarmed by it. No
contracts were made for the vagrant blacks under it; but its
effect, in inducing them to make contracts for themselves, was
immediate, wholesome, and very gratifying.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officers of the Bureau were everywhere subject to the
temptation of bribes; and I often heard planters remark that
they could do anything with the Bureau they pleased, if they
had plenty of money. General Tillson said, “I could make
a million dollars here very shortly, if I chose to be dishonest.
Only to-day I was offered a thousand dollars for one hundred
freedmen, by a rich planter.” He had made it a rule of the
Bureau to receive no personal fees whatever for any services.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over three thousand dollars had been paid in fines by the
people of Georgia for cruelties to the freedmen during the
past three months. “It is considered no murder to kill a
negro. The best men in the State admit that no jury would
convict a white man for killing a freedman, or fail to hang a
negro who had killed a white man in self-defence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The General added: “As soon as the troops were withdrawn
from Wilkes County, last November, a gang of jay-hawkers
went through, shooting and burning the colored
people, holding their feet and hands in the fire to make them
tell where their money was. It left such a stigma on the
county that the more respectable class held a meeting to denounce
it. This class is ashamed of such outrages, but it does
not prevent them, and it does not take them to heart; and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>could name a dozen cases of murder committed on the colored
people by young men of these first families.”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Tillson, by his tact, good sense, business capacity,
freedom from prejudice for or against color, and his uniform
candor, moderation, and justice, had secured for the Bureau
the coöperation of both the State Convention and the Legislature,
and was steadily winning the confidence and respect of
the planters. The most serious problem that remained to be
solved was the Sea-Island question, of which I shall speak
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prospect was favorable for a good cotton crop in Georgia,
although anxiety was felt with regard to the vitality of the
seed, much of which, being several years old, had no doubt
been injured by keeping.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since my return from the South, I have received a letter from a gentleman of
character, late an officer in the Federal army, from which I make the following extract
bearing on this subject:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“After leaving you at Grand Gulf, I rode twenty or thirty miles into the interior,
but could find little inducement for a Northern man to settle in that portion of the
South. The further you go from main routes, the more hostile you find the inhabitants.
I finally determined to locate on or near the Mississippi, and recent experience only
confirms my earlier impressions. I am now located on the river, one hundred and
sixty miles below Memphis, on the Arkansas side, and am making preparations to
plant one thousand acres of cotton. It has been very difficult to secure help here,
and I determined to make a trip to Georgia for the purpose of obtaining the requisite
number of hands. I succeeded tolerably well, and could have hired many more than
I needed, had not the people induced the negroes to believe that we were taking them
to Cuba to sell them. I award the palm to the Georgians, as the meanest and most
despicable class of people it was ever my misfortune to meet. While they are constantly
urging that the negro will not work, they use every means to dissuade
him from securing honorable and profitable employment. I was never so grossly
insulted as when in Georgia. They fear the powerful arm of the government, but
are to-day as bitter Rebels as at any time during the war. The consequences would
be most disastrous if the military force scattered through the South should be at once
removed.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>SHERMAN IN EASTERN GEORGIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The track of the Central Railroad, one hundred and ninety-one
miles in length, was destroyed with conscientious thoroughness
by Sherman’s army. From Gordon, twenty miles
below Macon, to Scarborough Station, nine miles below Millen,
a distance of one hundred miles, there was still an impassable
hiatus of bent rails and burnt bridges, at the time of my
journey; and in order to reach Savannah from Macon, it was
necessary to proceed by the Georgia road to Augusta, either
returning by railroad to Atlanta, or crossing over by railroad
and stage to Madison, between which places the Georgia road,
destroyed for a distance of sixty-seven miles, had been restored.
From Augusta I went down on the Augusta and
Savannah road to a station a few miles below Waynesboro’,
where a break in that road rendered it necessary to proceed
by stages to Scarborough. From Scarborough to Savannah
the road was once more in operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relaid tracks were very rough; many of the old rails
having been straightened and put down again. “General
Grant and his staff passed over this road a short time ago,”
said a citizen; “and as they went jolting along in an old box-car,
on plain board seats, they seemed to think it was great
fun: they said they were riding on Sherman’s <em>hair-pins</em>,”—an
apt name applied to the most frequent form in which the rails
were bent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sherman’s men had all sorts of machinery for destroying
the track. They could rip it up as fast as they could count.
They burnt the ties and fences to heat the iron; then two
men would take a bar and twist it or wrap it around a tree or
a telegraph post. Our people found some of their iron-benders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>and they helped mightily about straightening the
rails again. Only the best could be used. The rest the devil
can’t straighten.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Riding along by the destroyed tracks, it was amusing to see
the curious shapes in which the iron had been left. Hair-pins
predominated. Corkscrews were also abundant. Sometimes
we found four or five rails wound around the trunk of a tree,
which would have to be cut before they could be got off again.
And there was an endless variety of most ungeometrical twists
and curves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Central Railroad was probably the best in the State.
Before the war its stock paid annual dividends of fifteen per
cent.,—one year as high as twenty seven and a half per cent.
It owned property to the amount of a million and a half dollars,
mostly invested in Europe. This will be nearly or quite
sunk in repairing the damage done by Sherman. Then the
road will have all of its bent iron,—for Sherman could not
carry it away or burn it;—and this was estimated to be worth
two thirds as much as new iron. The track, composed partly
of the T and partly of the U rail, was well laid; and the
station-houses were substantially built of brick. I was told that
the great depot building at Millen, although of wood, was
equal in size and beauty to the best structures of the kind in
the North. Sherman did not leave a building on the road,
from Macon to Savannah. For warehouses, I found box-cars
stationed on the side tracks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants of Eastern Georgia suffered even more than
those of Middle Georgia from our army operations,—the
men having got used to their wild business by the time they
arrived there, and the General having, I suspect, slipped one
glove off. Here is the story of an old gentleman of Burke
County:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was the 14th Corps that came through my place. They
looked like a blue cloud coming. They had all kinds of music,—horns,
cow-bells, tin-pans, everything they could pick up
that would make a hideous noise. It was like Bedlam broke
loose. It was enough to frighten the old stumps in the deadenings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>say nothing about the people. They burned everything
but occupied dwellings. They cut the belluses at the
blacksmith-shops. They took every knife and fork and cooking
utensil we had. My wife just saved a frying-pan by
hanging on to it; she was considerable courageous, and they
left it in her hands. After that they came back to get her to
cook them some biscuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’How can I cook for you, when you’ve carried off everything?’
she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They told her if she would make them a batch of biscuit
they would bring back a sack of her own flour, and she should
have the balance of it. She agreed to it; but while the biscuit
was baking, another party came along and carried the
sack off again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The wife of one of my neighbors,—a very rich family,
brought up to luxuries,—just saved a single frying-pan, like
we did. Their niggers and all went off with Sherman; and
for a week or two they had to cook their own victuals in that
frying-pan, cut them with a pocket-knife, and eat them with
their fingers. My folks had to do the same, but we hadn’t
been brought up to luxuries, and didn’t mind it so much.</p>

<p class='c000'>“General Sherman went into the house of an old woman
after his men had been pillaging it. He sat down and drank
a glass of water. Says she to him, ‘I don’t wonder people
say you’re a smart man; for you’ve been to the bad place and
got scrapings the devil wouldn’t have.’ His soldiers heard of
it, and they took her dresses and hung them all up in the
highest trees, and drowned the cat in the well.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A neighbor of mine buried all his gold and silver, and
built a hog-pen over the spot. But the Yankees were mighty
sharp at finding things. They mistrusted a certain new look
about the hog-pen, ripped it away, stuck in their bayonets, and
found the specie.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Another of my neighbors hid his gold under the brick
floor of his smoke-house. He put down the bricks in the
same place; but the rascals smelt out the trick, pulled up the
floor, got the gold, and then burnt the smoke-house. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>made him take off his boots and hat, which they wore away.
They left him an old Yankee hat, which he now wears. He
swears he never’ll buy another till the government pays him
for his losses.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My wife did the neatest thing. She took all our valuables,
such as watches and silver-spoons, and hid them in the cornfield.
With a knife she would just make a slit in the ground,
open it a little, put in one or two things, and then let the top
earth down, just like it was before. Then she’d go on and
do the same thing in another place. The soldiers went all
over that cornfield sticking in their bayonets, but they didn’t
find a thing. The joke of it was, she came very near never
finding them again herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of my neighbors, a poor man, was stopped by some
cavalry boys, who demanded his watch. He told ’em it was
such a sorry watch they wouldn’t take it. They wanted to
see it, and when he showed it, they said, ‘Go along!—we
won’t be seen carrying off such a looking thing as that!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The following story was related to me by a Northern man,
who had been twenty-five years settled in Eastern Georgia:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My neighbors were too much frightened to do anything
well and in good order. But I determined I’d save as much
of my property as I could drive on its own feet or load on to
wagons. I took two loads of goods, and all my cattle and
hogs, and run ’em off twenty miles into Screven County. I
found a spot of rising ground covered with gall bushes, in the
middle of a low, wet place. I went through water six inches
deep, got to the knoll, cut a road through the bushes, run my
wagons in, and stuck the bushes down into the wet ground
where I had cut them. They were six or eight feet high, and
hid everything. My cattle and hogs I turned off in a bushy
field. After that, I went to the house of a poor planter and
staid. That was Friday night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sunday, the soldiers came. I lay hid in the woods, and
saw ’em pass close by the knoll where my goods were, running
in their bayonets everywhere. The bushes were green yet,
and they didn’t discover anything, though they passed right
by the edge of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>“All at once I heard the women of the house scream murder.
Thinks I, ‘It won’t do for me to be lying here looking
out only for my own interests, while the soldiers are abusing the
women.’ I crawled out of the bushes, and was hurrying back
to the house, when five cavalrymen overtook me. They put
their carbines to my head, and told me to give ’em my money.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As soon as I’d got over my fright a little, I said, ‘Gentlemen,
I’ve got some Confederate money, but it will do you no
good.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Give me your pistol,’ one said. I told him I had no
pistol. They thought I lied, for they saw something in my
pocket; but come to snatch it out, it was only my pipe. Then
they demanded my knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I’ve nothing but an old knife I cut my tobacco with;—you
won’t take an old man’s knife!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“They let me go, and I hurried on to the house. It was
full of soldiers. I certainly thought something dreadful was
happening to the women; but they were screeching because
the soldiers were carrying off their butter and honey and corn-meal.
They were making all that fuss over the loss of their
property; and I thought I might as well have stayed to watch
mine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That night the army camped about a mile from there; and
the next morning I rode over to see if I could get a safeguard
for the house. But the officers said no;—they were bound
to have something to eat. I went back, and left my horse at
the door while I stepped in to tell the women if they wished
to save anything that was left they must hide it. Before I
could get out again my horse was taken. I went on after it;
the army was on the march again, and I was told if I would
go with it all day, I should have my horse come night. I
marched a few miles, but got sick of it, and went back. I
could see big fires in the direction of my house, and I knew
that the town was burning.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I got back to the poor planter’s house, and found a new
misfortune had happened to him. The night before, all his
hogs and mine came together to his door,—the soldiers having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>let the fences down. ‘This won’t do,’ I said; ‘I’m going to
make another effort to save my hogs.’ But he was true Southern;
he hadn’t energy; he said, ‘No use!’ and just sat
still. I tolled my hogs off with corn, and scattered corn all
about in the bushes to keep them there. The next day it was
hot, and they lay in the shade to keep cool; so the soldiers
didn’t find them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But when, as I said, I got back to his house, I found the
soldiers slaughtering his hogs right and left. They killed
every one. So much for his lack of faith. But the worst
part of the joke was, they borrowed his cart to carry off his
own hogs to the wagon-train which was passing on another
road half a mile away. They said they’d bring it back in
an hour. As it didn’t come, he went for it, and found
they’d piled rails on to it and burnt it. I had taken care of
my wagons, and he might have done the same with his. But
that’s the difference between a Northern and a Southern man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Monday I returned home, and found my family living on
corn-meal bran. They had been robbed of everything. The
soldiers had even taken the hat off from my little grandson’s
head, six years old. They took a mother-hen away from her
little peeping chickens. There were fifty or a hundred soldiers
in the house all one day, breaking open chests and bureaus;
and those that come after took what the first had left.
My folks asked for protection, being Northern people; and
there was one officer who knew them; but he could control
only his own men. So we fared no better than our
neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The staging to Scarborough was very rough; but our route
lay through beautiful pine woods, carpeted with wild grass. It
was January, but the spring frogs were singing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best rolling-stock of the Central Road had been run
up to Macon on Sherman’s approach, and could not be got
down again. So I had the pleasure of riding from Scarborough
to Savannah in an old car crowded full of wooden chairs,
in place of the usual seats.</p>

<p class='c000'>The comments of the passengers on the destruction wrought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>by Sherman were sometimes bitter, sometimes sentimental.
A benevolent gentleman remarked: “How much good might
be done with the millions of property destroyed, by building
new railroads elsewhere!” To which a languishing lady
replied: “What is the use of building railroads for <em>slaves</em> to
ride on? I’d rather be free, and take it afoot, than belong to
the Yankees, and ride.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our route lay along the low, level borders of the Ogeechee
River, the soil of which is too cold for cotton. We passed
immense swamps, in the perfectly still waters of which the
great tree-trunks were mirrored. And all the way the spring
frogs kept up their shrill singing.</p>

<p class='c000'>At some of the stations I saw bales of Northern hay that
had come up from Savannah. “There is a commentary on our
style of farming,” said an intelligent planter from near Millen.
“This land, though worthless for cotton, could be made to
grow splendid crops of grass,—and we import our hay.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXX.<br /> <span class='large'>A GLANCE AT SAVANNAH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 16th of November, 1864, Sherman began his grand
march from Atlanta. In less than a month his army had
made a journey of three hundred miles, consuming and devastating
the country. On December 13th, by the light of
the setting sun, General Hazen’s Division of the 15th Corps
made it’s brilliant and successful assault on Fort McAlister on
the Ogeechee, opening the gate to Savannah and the sea. On
the night of the 20th, Savannah was hurriedly evacuated by
the Rebels, and occupied by Sherman on the 21st. The city,
with a thousand prisoners, thirty-five thousand bales of cotton,
two hundred guns, three steamers, and valuable stores, thus
fell into our hands without a battle. Within forty-eight hours
a United States transport steamer came to the wharf, and the
new base of supplies, about which we were all at that time
so anxious, was established.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city was on fire during the evacuation. Six squares
and portions of other squares were burned. At the same
time a mob collected and commenced breaking into stores and
dwellings. The destroyers of railroads were in season to save
the city from the violence of its own citizens.</p>

<p class='c000'>A vast multitude of negroes had followed the army to the
sea. This exodus of the bondmen from the interior had been
permitted, not simply as a boon to them, but as an injury to
the resources of the Confederacy, like the destruction of its
plantations and railroads. What to do with them now became
a serious problem. Of his conference with Secretary Stanton
on the subject at Savannah, General Sherman says: “We
agreed perfectly that the young and able-bodied men should
be enlisted as soldiers or employed by the quartermaster in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>the necessary work of unloading ships, and for other army
purposes; but this left on our hands the old and feeble, the
women and children, who had necessarily to be fed by the
United States. Mr. Stanton summoned a large number of
the old negroes, mostly preachers, with whom he held a long
conference, of which he took down notes. After this conference,
he was satisfied the negroes could, with some little aid
from the United States by means of the abandoned plantations
on the sea islands and along the navigable rivers, take care
of themselves.” Sherman’s “General Orders No. 15” were
the result, giving negro settlers “possessory titles” to these
lands. Thus originated the knotty Sea-Island controversy, of
which more by-and-by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aspect of Savannah is peculiarly Southern, and not
without a certain charm. Its uniform squares, its moist and
heavy atmosphere, the night fogs that infest it, the dead level
of its sandy streets, shaded by two and four rows of moss-draped
trees, and its frequent parks of live-oaks, water-oaks,
wild-olives, and magnolias, impress you singularly. The city,
notwithstanding its low, flat appearance, is built on a plain
forty feet above the river. The surrounding country is an
almost unbroken level. Just across the Savannah lie the low,
marshy shores of South Carolina. It is the largest city of
Georgia, having something like twenty-five thousand inhabitants.
Here, before the war, dwelt the aristocracy of the
country, living in luxurious style upon the income of slave
labor on the rice and cotton plantations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trade was less active at Savannah than in some of the
interior towns, owing to its greater isolation. A flood of
business passed through it, however. The expense of transportation
was very great. Every bale of cotton brought down
the river from Augusta, two hundred and thirty miles, cost
eight dollars; and the tariff on returning freights was two
cents a pound.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were sixteen hundred colored children in Savannah,
twelve hundred of whom attended school. Three hundred
and fifty attended the schools of the Savannah Educational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>Association, organized and supported by the colored population.
I visited one of these schools, taught by colored persons,
in a building which was a famous slave-mart, in the good
old days of the institution. In the large auction-room, and
behind the iron-barred windows of the jail-room over it, the
children of slaves were now enjoying one of the first, inestimable
advantages of freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you go to Savannah, do not fail to visit the Bonaventure
Cemetery, six miles from the city. You drive out southward
on the Thunderbolt Road, past the fortifications, through fields
of stumps and piny undergrowths, whose timber was cut away
to give range to the guns, to the fragrant, sighing solitude of
pine woods beyond. Leaving the main road, you pass beneath
the low roof of young evergreen oaks overarching the path.
This leads you into avenues of indescribable beauty and
gloom. Whichever way you look, colonnades of huge live-oak
trunks open before you, solemn, still, and hoary. The
great limbs meeting above are draped and festooned with long
fine moss. Over all is a thick canopy of living green, shutting
out the glare of day. Beneath is a sparse undergrowth
of evergreen bushes, half concealing a few neglected old family
monuments. The area is small, but a more fitting scene for a
cemetery is not conceivable.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>CHARLESTON AND THE WAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The railroad from Savannah to Charleston, one hundred
and four miles in length, running through a country of rice-plantations,
was struck and smashed by Sherman in his march
<em>from</em> the sea. As it never was a paying road before the war,
I could see no prospect of its being soon repaired. The highway
of the ocean supplies its place. There was little travel
and less business between the two cities, two or three small
steamers a week being sufficient to accommodate all. Going
on board one of these inferior boats at three o’clock one afternoon,
at Savannah, I awoke the next morning in Charleston
harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A warm, soft, misty morning it was, the pale dawn breaking
through rifts in the light clouds overhead, a vapory horizon of
dim sea all around. What is that great bulk away on our left,
drifting past us? That is the thing known as Fort Sumter:
it does not float from its rock so easily: it is we who are drifting
past it. We have just left Fort Moultrie on our right;
the low shores on which it crouches lie off there still visible,
like banks of heavier mist. That obscure phenomenon ahead
yonder looms too big for a hencoop, and turns out to be Fort
Ripley. The dawn brightens, the mist clears, and we see, far
on our right, Castle Pinckney; and on our left a gloomy line
of pine forests, which we are told is James Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is historic ground we are traversing,—or rather historic
water. How the heart stirs with the memories it calls
up! What is that at anchor yonder? A monitor! A man
on its low flat deck walks almost level with the water. Two
noticeable objects follow after us: one is a high-breasted,
proud-beaked New York steamer; the other, the wonderful
light of dawn dancing upon the waves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>Before us all the while, rising and expanding as we approach,
its wharves and shipping, its warehouses and church steeples,
gradually taking shape, on its low peninsula thrust out between
the two rivers, is the haughty and defiant little city that inaugurated
treason, that led the Rebellion, that kindled the fire it
took the nation’s blood to quench. And is it indeed you, city
of Charleston, lying there so quiet, harmless, half asleep, in
the peaceful morning light? Where now are the joy-intoxicated
multitudes who thronged your batteries and piers and
house-tops, to see the flag of the Union hauled down from
yonder shattered little fortress? Have you forgotten the
frantic cheers of that frantic hour? Once more the old flag
floats there! How do you like the looks of it, city of Charleston?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_512.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>I gave my travelling-bag to a black boy on the wharf, who
took it on his head and led the way through the just awakened
streets to the Mills House.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of the city in the early morning atmosphere,
was prepossessing. It is a well built, light, and airy city. It
lacks the broad streets, the public squares, and the forest of
trees, which give to Savannah its charm; but it strikes one as
a more attractive place for a residence. You are not at all
oppressed with a sense of the lowness of the situation; and
yet it is far less elevated than Savannah, the flat and narrow
peninsula on which it is built rising but a few feet above high
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charleston did not strike me as a very cleanly town, and I
doubt if it ever was such. Its scavengers are the turkey
buzzards. About the slaughter-pens on the outskirts of the
city, at the markets, and wherever garbage abounds, these
black, melancholy birds, properly vultures, congregate in numbers.
There is a law against killing them, and they are very
tame. In contrast with these obscenities are the gardens of
the suburban residences, green in midwinter with semi-tropical
shrubs and trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here centred the fashion and aristocracy of South Carolina,
before the war. Charleston was the watering-place where the
rich cotton and rice planters, who lived upon their estates in
winter, came to lounge away the summer season, thus inverting
the Northern custom. It has still many fine residences,
built in a variety of styles; but, since those recent days of its
pride and prosperity, it has been wofully battered and desolated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great fire of 1861 swept diagonally across the city from
river to river. A broad belt of ruin divides what remains.
One eighth of the entire city was burned, comprising much
of its fairest and wealthiest quarter. No effort had yet been
made to rebuild it. The proud city lies humbled in its ashes,
too poor to rise again without the helping hand of Northern
Capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>The origin of this stupendous fire still remains a mystery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>It is looked upon as one of the disasters of the war, although
it cannot be shown that it had any connection with the war.
When Eternal Justice decrees the punishment of a people, it
sends not War alone, but also its sister terrors, Famine, Pestilence,
and Fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ruins of Charleston are the most picturesque of any
I saw in the South. The gardens and broken walls of many
of its fine residences remain to attest their former elegance.
Broad, semicircular flights of marble steps, leading up once
to proud doorways, now conduct you, over their cracked and
calcined slabs, to the level of high foundations swept of everything
but the crushed fragments of their former superstructures,
with here and there a broken pillar, and here and there
a windowless wall. Above the monotonous gloom of the ordinary
ruins rise the churches,—the stone tower and roofless
walls of the Catholic Cathedral, deserted and solitary, a roost
for buzzards; the burnt-out shell of the Circular Church, interesting
by moonlight, with its dismantled columns still standing,
like those of an antique temple; and others scarcely less
noticeable.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are additional ruins scattered throughout the lower
part of the city, a legacy of the Federal bombardment. The
Scotch Church, a large structure, with two towers and a row
of front pillars, was rendered untenantable by ugly breaches
in its roof and walls, that have not yet been repaired. The
old Custom-House and Post-Office building stands in an exceedingly
dilapidated condition, full of holes. Many other
public and private buildings suffered no less. Some were quite
demolished; while others have been patched up. After all,
it would seem that the derisive laughter with which the
Charlestonians, according to contemporaneous accounts in
their newspapers, received the Yankee shells, must have been
of a forced or hysterical nature. Yet I found those who still
maintained that the bombardment did not amount to much.
A member of the city fire department said to me:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_514.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>LEAVING CHARLESTON ON THE CITY BEING BOMBARDED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>“But few fires were set by shells. There were a good
many fires, but they were mostly set by mischief-makers.
The object was to get us firemen down in shelling range.
There was a spite against us, because we were exempt from
military duty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fright of the inhabitants, however, was generally
frankly admitted. The greatest panic occurred immediately
after the occupation of Morris Island by General Gillmore.
“The first shells set the whole town in commotion. It looked
like everybody was skedaddling. Some loaded up their goods,
and left nothing but their empty houses. Others just packed
up a few things in trunks and boxes, and abandoned the rest.
The poor people and negroes took what they could carry on
their backs or heads, or in their arms, and put for dear life.
Some women put on all their dresses, to save them. For a while
the streets were crowded with runaways,—hurrying, hustling,
driving,—on horseback, in wagons, and on foot,—white folks,
dogs, and niggers. But when it was found the shells only fell
down town, the people got over their scare; and many who
went away came back again. Every once in a while, however,
the Yankees would appear to mount a new gun, or get
a new gunner; and the shells would fall higher up. That
would start the skedaddling once more. One shell would be
enough to depopulate a whole neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A Northern man, who was in Charleston during the war,
told me that he was lying sick in a house which was struck
by a shell early during the bombardment. “A darkey that
was nursing me took fright and ran away, and left me in about
as unpleasant a condition as I was ever in. I couldn’t stir
from my bed, and there was much more danger that I might
die from neglect, than from Gillmore’s shells. Finally a friend
found me out, and removed me to another house a few streets
above. It was nine months before the shells reached us there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The shelling began in July, 1863, and was kept up pretty
regularly until the surrender of the city, on the 18th of February,
1865. This last event occurred just four years after
the inauguration of Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederate
States. How did the people of Charleston keep that
last glorious anniversary?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Sherman’s northward marching army having flanked the
city, its evacuation was not unexpected; but when it came,
confusion and dismay came with it. The Rebel troops, departing,
adhered to their usual custom of leaving ruin behind
them. They fired the upper part of the city, burning an immense
quantity of cotton, with railroad buildings and military
stores. While the half-famished poor were rushing early in
the morning to secure a little of the Confederate rice in one
of the warehouses, two hundred kegs of powder blew up, killing
and mutilating a large number of those unfortunate people.
Here also it devolved upon the Union troops to save the city
from the fires set by its own friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the sixty-five thousand inhabitants which the city contained
at the beginning of the secession war, only about ten
thousand remained at the time of the occupation by our troops.
Those belonged mostly to the poorer classes, who could not
get away. Many people rushed in from the suburbs, got
caught inside the intrenchments, and could not get out again.
Others rushed out panic-stricken from the burning city, and
when they wished to return, found that they could not.
Charleston, from the moment of its occupation, was a sealed
city. Families were divided. Husbands shut within the line
of fortifications drawn across the neck of the peninsula, could
not hear from their families in the country; and wives in the
country could not get news from their husbands. “It was
two months before I could learn whether my husband was
dead or alive,” said a lady, who took refuge in the interior.
And some who remained in Charleston, told me it was a
month before they heard of the burning of Columbia; that
they could not even learn which way Sherman’s army had
gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>A VISIT TO FORT SUMTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One morning I went on board the government supply
steamer “Mayflower,” plying between the city and the forts
below. As we steamed down to the rows of piles, driven
across the harbor to compel vessels to pass under the guns of
the forts, I noticed that they were so nearly eaten off by
worms that, had the war continued a year or two longer, it
would have been necessary to replace them. There is in
these Southern waters an insect very destructive to the wood
it comes in contact with. It cannot live in fresh water, and
boats, the bottoms of which are not sheathed, or covered with
tar, are taken occasionally up the rivers, to get rid of it. Only
the palmetto is able to resist its ravages; of the tough logs of
which the wharves of Charleston are constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Sumter loomed before us, an enormous mass of ruins.
We approached on the northeast side, which appeared covered
with blotches and patches of a most extraordinary description,
commemorating the shots of our monitors. The notches in
the half-demolished wall were mended with gabions. On the
southeast side not an angle, not a square foot of the original
octagonal wall remained, but in its place was an irregular
steeply sloping bank of broken bricks, stones, and sand,—a
half-pulverized mountain, on which no amount of shelling
could have any other effect than to pulverize it still more.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could now readily understand the Rebel boast, that Fort
Sumter, after each attack upon it, was stronger than ever.
Stronger for defence, as far as its walls were concerned, it
undoubtedly was; but where were the double rows of portholes
for heavy ordnance, and the additional loopholes on the
south side for musketry? Our guns had faithfully smashed
everything of that kind within their range.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>On the northwest side, facing the city, the perpendicular
lofty wall stands in nearly its original condition, its scientific
proportions, of stupendous solid masonry, astonishing us by
their contrast with the other sides. Between this wall and
the wreck of a Rebel steamer, shot through and sunk whilst
bringing supplies to the fort, we landed. By flights of wooden
steps we reached the summit, and looked down into the huge
crater within. This is a sort of irregular amphitheatre, with
sloping banks of gabions and rubbish on all sides save one.
On the southeast side, where the exterior of the fort received
the greatest damage from the guns on Morris Island, the interior
received the least. There are no casemates left, except
on that side. In the centre stands the flag-staff, bearing
aloft the starry symbol of the national power, once humbled
here, and afterwards trailed long through bloody dust, to float
again higher and haughtier than ever, on those rebellious
shores. Who, that loves his country, can look upon it there
without a thrill?</p>

<p class='c000'>The fort is built upon a mole, which is flooded by high-water.
It was half-tide that morning, and climbing down the
slope of the southeast embankment, I walked upon the beach
below,—or rather upon the litter of old iron that strewed it
thick as pebble-stones. It was difficult to step without placing
the foot upon a rusty cannon-ball or the fragment of a shell.
The curling waves broke upon beds of these iron debris,
extending far down out of sight into the sea. I suggested to
an officer that this would be a valuable mine to work, and
was told that the right to collect the old iron around the fort
had already been sold to a speculator for thirty thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following statement of the cost to the United States of
some of the forts seized by the Rebels, and of others they
would have been glad to seize, but could not see their way
clear to do so, will interest a few readers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Moultrie, $87,601. (Evacuated by Major Anderson
Dec. 26th, 1860.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Castle Pinckney, $53,809. (Seized by South Carolina
State troops, Dec. 27th, 1860.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>Fort Sumter, $977,404.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Pulaski, at the mouth of the Savannah River, $988,859.
(Seized by order of Governor Brown, Jan. 3d, 1861.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Morgan, Mobile Harbor, $1,242,552. (Seized Jan.
4th, 1861.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Gaines, opposite, $221,500. (Same fate.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Jackson, on the Mississippi, below New Orleans, $837,608.
Its fellow, Fort St. Philip, $258,734. (Both seized
Jan. 10th, 1861.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, $1,208,000. (Not convenient
for the Rebels to appropriate.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortress Monroe, the most expensive, as it is the largest of
our forts, $2,476,771. (Taken by Jeff Davis in May, 1865,
under peculiar circumstances, and still occupied by him at this
date, May, 1866.)</p>

<p class='c000'>I found eighty-five United States soldiers in Sumter: a
mere handful, yet they were five more than the garrison that
held it at the time of Beauregard’s bombardment in April,
1861. My mind went back to those earlier days, and to that
other little band. How anxiously we had watched the newspapers,
week after week, to see if the Rebels would <em>dare</em> to
execute their threats! Even the children caught the excitement,
and asked eagerly, as papa came home at night with the
news, “Is Fort Sumter attackted?” At last the defiant act
was done, and what a raging, roaring fire it kindled all over
the land! How our hearts throbbed in sympathy with Major
Anderson and his seventy-nine heroes! Major, Colonel, General
Anderson,—well might he step swiftly up the degrees of
rank, for he was already atop of our hearts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was so easy for a man to blaze forth into sudden glory of
renown at that time! One true, loyal, courageous deed, and
fame was secure. But when the hurricane howl of the storm
was at its height, when the land was all on fire with such
deeds, glory was not so cheap. Only the taller flame could
make itself distinguished, only the more potent voice be heard
amid the roar. So many a hero of many a greater exploit
than Anderson’s passed on unnoted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>And looking back coolly at the event from the walls of
Sumter to-day, it is not easy to understand how a patriot and
a soldier, who knew his duty, could have sat quiet in his fortress
while Rebel batteries were rising all around him. He
was acting on the defensive, you say,—waiting for the Rebels
to commence hostilities. But hostilities had already begun.
The first spadeful of earth thrown up, to protect the first
Rebel gun, within range of Sumter, was an act of war upon
Sumter. To wait until surrounded by a ring of fire, which
could not be resisted, before opening the guns of the fort,
appears, by the light both of military duty and of common
sense, absurd. But fortunately something else rules, in a
great revolution, besides military duty and common sense;
and in the plan of that Providence which shapes our ways, I
suppose Major Anderson did the best and only thing that was
to be done. Besides, forbearance, to the utmost verge of that
virtue, and sometimes a little beyond, was the policy of the
government he served.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reëmbarking on the steamer, and running over to Morris
Island, I noticed that Sumter, from that side, looked like nothing
but a solitary sandy bluff, heaved up in the middle of the
harbor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A PRISON AND A PRISONER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Is this your first visit to Charleston?” I asked General
S——, one day as we dined together.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My first visit,” he replied, “occurred in the summer of
1864, considerably against my inclination. I was lodged at
the expense of the Confederate Government in the Work-House,—not
half as comfortable a place as this hotel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both visits were made in the service of the United States
Government; but under what different circumstances! Then,
a helpless, insulted prisoner; now, he came in a capacity
which brought to him as humble petitioners some of the most
rebellious citizens of those days. When sick and in prison,
they did not minister unto him; but since he sat in an office
of public power, nothing could exceed their polite, hat-in-hand
attentions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dinner over, he proposed that we should go around and
look at his old quarters in the Work-House. I gladly assented,
and, on the way, drew from him the story of his
capture.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was taken prisoner at the battle of July 22d, before
Atlanta, and placed on a train, with a number of other prisoners,
to be conveyed to Macon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When we were about ten or a dozen miles from Macon,
I went and sat on the platform with the guard. To prevent
his suspecting my design, I told him I was disabled by rheumatism,
and complained of pain and weakness in my back.
He presently leaned against the car, and closed his eyes; like
everybody else after the battles of July, he was pretty well
used up, and in a few minutes he appeared to be asleep. His
gun was cocked, ready to shoot any prisoner that attempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>to escape; and I quietly took the cap off, without disturbing
him. Then I didn’t dare wait a minute for a better opportunity,
but jumped when I could. We were five or six miles
from Macon, and the train was running about ten miles an
hour. As I took my leap, I felt my hat flying from my head,
and instinctively put up my hand and caught it, knowing if it
was lost it might give a clew that would lead to my recapture.
All this passed through my mind while I went rolling down an
embankment eighteen or twenty feet high. I thought I never
should strike the bottom. When I did, the concussion was
so great that I lay under a fence, nearly senseless, for I don’t
know how long: I couldn’t have moved, even if I had known
a minute’s delay would cause me to be retaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After a while I recovered, got up, crossed the fields, and
found a road on the edge of some woods. It was then just at
dusk. I walked all night, and in the morning found myself
where I started. I had been walking around a hill, on a road
made by woodmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was very tired, but I made up my mind I must leave
that place. I got the points of the compass by the light in the
east, and started to walk in a northerly direction, hoping to
strike our lines somewhere near Atlanta. I soon passed a
field of squealing hogs. I ought to have taken warning by
their noise; but I kept on, and presently met a man with a
bag of corn on his shoulder, going to feed them. I was walking
fast, with my coat on my arm; and we passed each other
without saying a word. My whole appearance was calculated
to excite suspicion. Besides, one might know by my uniform
that I was a Yankee officer. I suppose, by the law of self-defence,
I ought to have turned about and put him out of the
way of doing me any mischief. It would have been well for
me if I had. I was soon out of sight; but I could hear the
hogs squealing still, so I knew he had not stopped to give
them the corn; I knew he had dropped his bag and run, as
well as if I had watched him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I crossed the fields to the road, where I saw somebody
coming very fast on a horse. I hid in some weeds, and presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>saw this same man riding by at a sharp gallop towards a
neighboring plantation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I knew I had a hard time before me. I first sat
down and rubbed pine leaves and tobacco on the soles of my
boots; then took once more to the fields. It wasn’t an hour
before I heard the bloodhounds on my track. I can never
tell what I suffered during the next three days. I did not
sleep at all; I travelled almost incessantly. Sometimes when
I stopped to rest the dogs would come in sight; and often I
could hear them when I did not see them. I baffled them
continually by changing my course, walking in streams, and
rubbing tobacco and pine leaves on my boot-soles.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did you live on all this time?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will tell you what I ate: three crackers, which I had
with me when I jumped from the cars, one water-melon, and
some raw green corn I picked in a field. The third day I
got rid of the dogs entirely. I saw a lonely looking house on
a hill, and went to it. It was occupied by a widow. I asked
for something to eat, and she cooked me a dinner while I kept
watch for the dogs. Perhaps she was afraid to do differently;
but she appeared very kind. When the dinner was ready I
was so sick from excitement and exhaustion that I couldn’t
eat. I managed to force down an egg and a spoonful of peas,
and that was all. The Rebels had taken my money, and I
could pay her only with thanks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I travelled nearly all that night again. Towards morning
I lay by in a canebrake, and slept a little. It was raining
hard. The next day I started on again. As I was crossing
a road, suddenly a man came round a steep bank, on horseback.
I didn’t see him until he was right upon me. I felt
desperate. He asked me some question, and I gave him a
surly answer. I thought I wouldn’t leave the road until he
had gone on; but he checked his horse, and rode along by
my side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’You look like you are in trouble,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I am,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Can I be of any service to you?’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>“’Yes. I want to go to Crawford’s Station. How far is
it?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He said it was three miles, and told me the way to go.
Crawford’s is only fifteen miles from Macon; so you see I had
not got far whilst running from the dogs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suddenly a terrible impulse took me. I turned upon him;
I felt fierce; I could have murdered him, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’I told you a lie,’ said I. ‘I am not going to Crawford’s.
I am a Federal soldier trying to escape.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He turned pale. ‘I am the provost-marshal of this district,’
he said, after we had looked each other full in the face
for about a minute, ‘and do you know it is my duty to arrest
you?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then a power came upon me such as I never felt before
in my life; and I talked to him. I laid open the whole question
of the war with a clearness and force which astonishes me
now when I think of it. I believe I convinced him. Then I
told him that if <em>I</em> had been doing <em>my</em> duty, it was <em>his</em> duty to
help me escape, instead of arresting me. And then I prophesied:—‘This
war is going to end,’ I said; ‘and it is going to
end in only one way. As true as there is a heaven above us,
your Confederate Government is going to be wiped from the
earth; and then where will you be? then what will you think
of the duty of one man to arrest another whose only fault is
that he has been fighting for his country? The time is coming,
sir, when it may make a mighty difference with you,
whether you help me now, or send me to a Rebel prison.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He looked at me in perfect amazement. He did not answer
me a word; only when I got through he said, ‘I’d give
a thousand dollars if I had not met you!’ I got down to
drink from a ditch by the road. Then he said, ‘I’ve got a
canteen at the house which you might have.’ That was the
first intimation I received that he would help me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He told me to stay where I was and he would bring me
something better to drink than ditch-water. I looked him
through. ‘I’ll trust you,’ I said; for no man ever looked as
he did who wasn’t sincere. Yet there was danger he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>change his mind; and I waited with great anxiety to see
whether he would bring the canteen or a guard of soldiers.
At last he came—with the canteen! It was full of the most
delicious spring water. I can’t begin to tell you how good
that water tasted! The nectar of the gods was nothing to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That night he hid me between two bales of cotton in his
gin-house. He brought me bacon and biscuits enough to last
me two or three days. What was more to the purpose, he
gave me a suit of citizens’ clothes to put on. While it was
yet early, he brought me out, and went with me a mile or so
on my way. He gave me the names of several citizens of the
country, so that I could claim to be going to see them if anybody
questioned me. I carried my uniform with me tied up
in a bundle, which I intended to drop in the first piece of
woods at a safe distance from his house. I never parted with
a man under more affecting circumstances. An enemy, he
had risked his life to save me,—for we both knew that if the
part he took in my escape was discovered, his reward would
be the halter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had a valuable gold watch, which the Rebels had not
taken from me, and I urged him to accept it. ‘If I am recaptured,’
I said, ‘some Confederate soldier will get it. If I
escape, it will be the greatest source of satisfaction I can have
to know that you keep this token of my gratitude.’ At last
he consented to accept it, and we parted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I travelled due north all that day, and lay by at night in
a canebrake. How it rained again! The next day, in avoiding
the main roads, as I had been careful to do whenever I
could, I got entangled among streams that put into the Ocmulgee
River. I came to a large one, and as I was turning back
from it, I saw a squad of soldiers going down to it to bathe. I
was in a complete <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</span></i>, and I must either run for the river
or meet them. I put on a bold face, and went out towards
them. As it was an extraordinary situation for a stranger to
be in, they naturally suspected everything was not right. They
asked me where I was from, and where I was going. I said
I came from near Macon, and that I was going to visit my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>uncle, Dr. Moore, in De Kalb County. I suppose my speech
betrayed me. They didn’t suspect me of being an escaped
prisoner; but their captain said, ‘I believe you’re a damned
Yankee spy.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“That sealed my fate. I was taken to Forsyth, on the
Macon and Western Railroad, where I was finally recognized
by the guard I had escaped from.</p>

<p class='c000'>“While I was sitting in the depot, in my citizens’ clothes, a
half-drunken Confederate soldier came in, flourishing a loaded
pistol, and inquiring for the ‘damned Yankee.’ ‘What do
you want of him?’ I asked. ‘To shoot his heart out!’ said
he. ‘What!’ said I, ‘would you shoot a prisoner? I hope
you are too chivalrous to do that.’ ‘It’s a part of my chivalry
to kill every Yankee I find,’ said he. ‘Just show him to me,
and you’ll see.’ ‘I’ll show him to you. I am the man. Now
let’s see you shoot him.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He swore I was joking. He wouldn’t believe I was the
Yankee, even when the guard told him I was; and he went
blustering away again. I suspect that he was a fellow of more
talk than courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Meanwhile Mr. T——, who gave me my citizens’ dress,
heard of my recapture, and came over to Forsyth, in great anxiety
lest I should betray him. I pretended not to recognize
him, but gave him to understand by a look that his secret was
safe. He said it was very important to ascertain how I came
by my clothes, and questioned me. I said I obtained them of
a good and true man, whom I should never name to his injury;
but that I would tell where I left my uniform, because I wished
to get it again. When I described the spot, he said he believed
he recognized it, and, if so, that it was on one of his neighbors’
plantations. He sent to search, and the next day I received
my uniform. I forgot to state that when I was retaken, my
drawers were mildewed from my lying out in the cane-brakes
in the rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From Forsyth I was sent to the stockade at Macon, where
I found my companions from whom I separated when I jumped
from the car. I hadn’t been there three days when I formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>a new plan of escape. I got the other prisoners enlisted in it,
and we went to tunnelling the ground under the stockade.
Each man worked with a knife, or a piece of hoop,—anything
that he could scratch with,—and filled a haversack
with the dirt, which was brought out and scattered over the
ground. As prisoners exposed to the weather were always
burrowing in caves, our design was not suspected. It was
exceedingly toilsome work, and it was carried on principally
by night. You would be astonished to see how much a man
will accomplish, with not much besides his finger-nails to do
with, when his liberty is at stake. We worked six tunnels,
three feet high, and extending well out beyond the stockade.
The very night when we were going to open them up on the
outside, one of the prisoners, a Kentuckian, betrayed us. If
we had found out who he was, he wouldn’t have lived a minute.
Then, just as I was maturing another plan, I was sent
here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We were at the Work-House, a castle-like building, flanked
by two tall towers; built of brick, but covered with a cement
in imitation of freestone. Before the war it was used as a
safe place of deposit for that description of property known
as slaves. Negroes for sale and awaiting the auction-day, negroes
who had or had not merited chastisement not convenient
for their city masters or mistresses to administer at home, negroes
who had run away, or were in danger of running away,
were sent here for safe-keeping or scientific flogging, as the
case might be. It was a mere jail, with cells and bolts and
bars, like any other. During the war, the negroes were transferred
to another building near by, and the “Work-House”
became a Yankee prison, in which officers were confined.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same block was the City Jail, likewise turned into
a prison for Federal officers. The Roper and Marine Hospitals,
not far off, were put to the same use.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a dungeon-like entrance, dark and low and damp,
to which we gained admittance through a heavy door that
creaked harshly on its hinges.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I first entered here,” said General S——, “a cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>shudder ran over me. I looked around for a chance to escape,
and saw behind and on each side of me two rows of bayonets,
not encouraging to the most enterprising man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>We walked through the empty, foul, and dismal passages, up-stairs
and down-stairs; visited the various cells, the old negro
whipping-room, the room in which General Stoneman, the
captured raider, was confined; and at length came to a room
in the second story of the west tower, which was occupied by
General S—— and a dozen more Federal officers. There
were several wooden bunks in it, on which they slept; from
among which the General singled out his own. “This is the
old thing I lay on! Here is my mark!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked up: “Do you see that patched place in the roof?
A shell came in there one day, when we were lying on our
bunks. It made these holes in the floor. But it hurt no one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took me to the window. “That other tower was
knocked by a shell. It was one of our amusements to watch
the shells as they came up from Morris Island, rose over the
ruined Cathedral yonder, and passed diagonally across these
streets, until they fell. They were dropping all the time;
but the gunners knew where we were, and avoided us. At
night we could watch them from the time they rose, until,
after describing a beautiful curve, they fell and exploded.
Our guard was much more afraid of them than we were.
Every day there was a fire set by them. This burnt section
near the Work-House was set by a shell while I was here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We went down into the yard. “I never got outside of this
enclosure but once. Then I went through that gate for a load
of wood. I had a taste of the pure air, and I can’t tell you
how good it was! It exhilarated me like wine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other side of the yard was the building to which the
negroes were transferred. “Every day we could hear the
yells of those who were being whipped.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the yard is a wooden tower of observation, which we
climbed, and had a view of the city. It was occupied as a
lookout by the Rebel guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Near the foot of this tower,” said General S——, “was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>a small mountain of offal,—fragments of food, old bones, and
the like, thrown out from the prison; a horrible heap,—all a
moving mass of maggots,—left to engender disease. Luckily
for us, the men on guard were made sick by it, and it was
finally removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The officer who had control of the prison has been appointed
United States Marshal for the State of South Carolina,
for his kindness to us,” he continued. “It is strange I
never heard of his kindness when I was here. We were not
whipped like the negroes; but in other respects our treatment
was no better than they received. Out of curiosity I once
measured my rations for ten days, and counted just fifty-five
spoonfuls,—five and a half spoonfuls a day!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe the prisoners at the Roper Hospital were treated
very well. They had the run of the garden, and the privilege
of trading with the negroes through the fence. But those
who went there took an oath not to try to get away. I could
have gone there, if I would have consented to take such an
oath. But I wouldn’t sell the hope of escaping at any price.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hadn’t been here a week before we had three schemes
on foot for getting out. One was to cut through a board in
the yard fence; but we found we were watched too closely
for that. Another was to make a tunnel to the sewer in
the street in front of the prison, as I will show you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Descending the tower, he took me to an iron grating that
covered a dark cavity in the ground under one of the prison
passages.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is a large cistern, which we had exhausted of its
contents. One day I pulled up this grate, dropped down into
the hole, lighted a candle which I had in my pocket, and made
an exploration. On coming out I gave a favorable report, and
that night we went to digging. We tunnelled first through
the cistern wall, then through the foundation wall of the
prison, and got into the sand under the street. We half filled
the old cistern with the stones and dirt we dug out with sticks,
old bones, and any bits of iron we could lay our hands on.
We worked like rats. Two or three of us were constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>in the tunnel, while others kept watch above. A friend outside
had given us information with regard to the position of
the sewer; we had already struck it, and the next night we
should have got into it, and into the street beyond the prison
guard, when once more we were betrayed by the same Kentuckian
who exposed our scheme at Macon. This time we
found him out, and he had to be removed from the prison to
save his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We had our third and great plan in reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There were at that time six hundred prisoners in the
Work-House, three hundred in the City Jail adjoining, and
one thousand in the Roper and Marine Hospitals, within an
arrow’s shot. These were officers. At the Race-Course
prison, on the outskirts of the town, there were four thousand
enlisted men. Our guard, here at the Work-House, consisted
of three reliefs of thirty-three men each. They were mere
militia, that had never seen service. Old soldiers like us were
not afraid of such fellows; and we knew that if we made a
demonstration they would be afraid of us. Our plan was, for
two prisoners, at a given signal, to leap on the back of each
one of the guard in the prison, and disarm him. Possibly
some of us might get hurt, but we were pretty sure of success.
Then, with the arms thus secured, we could easily capture
the second relief guard as it marched in. Then we were
to rush out immediately and seize the third relief. This would
give us ninety-nine guns. With these we were to march directly
upon the arsenal, capture it, and provide ourselves with
all the arms and ammunition we needed. Then to release
the thirteen hundred officers at the jail and hospitals, and the
four thousand privates at the Race-Course, would have been
easy; and we should have had a force of near six thousand
men. With these, the city would have been in our power.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our plan then was, to set fires clear across it, from river
to river, to make a barricade of burning buildings against the
Rebel artillery that would have been coming down to look
after us. Of course the panic and confusion of the citizens
would have been extreme, and the military would hardly have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>known what we were about; while our plans were laid with
mathematical precision. Our friend outside had smuggled in
to us, done up in balls of bread, a map of Charleston, with
complete explanations of every point about which we needed
information; and through him we had communicated with our
friends on Morris Island. We were to seize the shipping,
capture the water-batteries, and hold the lower part of the
town until our friends, under cover of a furious bombardment,
could come to our assistance. My whole heart was in this
scheme, and the time was set for its execution. The very day
before the day appointed, I was exchanged, together with the
principal leaders in it. To be let out just on the eve of what
promised to be such a brilliant exploit, was almost a disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am still interested to know-one thing,” I said. “Have
you ever heard from the Rebel who gave you the citizen’s
dress?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“After the breaking up of the rebellion I wrote to him,
making inquiries concerning his condition. He replied, saying
that he had come out of the war a poor man, and that he did
not know how he was to relieve the destitution of his family.
I immediately made application in his behalf to the War Department,
and obtained for him a pardon, and a place under
the government, in his own county, which he now fills, and
which yields him a liberal income.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SEA ISLANDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The plantation negro of the great cotton and rice-growing
States is a far more ignorant and degraded creature than the
negro of Virginia and Tennessee. This difference is traceable
to a variety of causes. First, the farmers of the slave-breeding
States were formerly accustomed to select, from among their
servants, the most stupid and vicious class, to be sold in the
Southern market. To the same destination went all the more
modern importations of raw savages from the coast of Africa.
The negro is susceptible to the influences of civilization; and
in the border States his intelligence was developed by much
intercourse with the white race. His veins also received a
generous infusion of the superior blood. The same may be
said of house and town servants throughout the South. The
slaves of large and isolated plantations, however, enjoyed but
limited advantages of this sort; seeing little of civilized society
beyond the overseer, whose lessons were not those of grace,
and the poor whites around them, scarcely more elevated in
the scale of being than themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In South Carolina the results of these combined causes are
more striking than in any other State. The excess of her
black population, and the unmitigated character of slavery
within her borders, afford perhaps a sufficient explanation of
this fact. In 1860 she had 291,388 white, 402,406 slave, and
9,914 free colored inhabitants. Even these figures do not
indicate the overwhelming predominance of black numbers in
certain localities. In the poorer districts, as counties are here
called, the whites are in a majority; while in certain others
there were three and four times as many negroes as white persons.
Herded together in great numbers, and worked like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>cattle, the habits of these wretched people, their comforts and
enjoyments, were little above those of the brute. Under such
circumstances it was hardly possible for them to make any
moral or intellectual advancement, but often, even to the third
generation, they remained as ignorant as when brought from
the wilds of Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was owing much no doubt to this excessive black population
and its degraded character, that labor appeared to be more
disorganized, and the freedmen in a worse condition in South
Carolina, than elsewhere. The Sea-Island question, however,
had had a very marked and injurious effect upon labor in the
State, and should be taken into consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ignorant of the blacks have certain true and strong
instincts, which stand them in the place of actual knowledge.
Their faith in Providence has a depth and integrity which
shames the halting belief of the more enlightened Christian.
Next to that, and strangely blended with it, is the faith in the
government which has brought them out of bondage. Along
with these goes the simple and strong conviction, that, in order
to be altogether free, and to enjoy the fruits of their freedom,
they must have homes of their own. The government encouraged
them in that belief and hope. Conscious of their
own loyalty, and having a clear understanding of the disloyalty
of their masters, they expected confidently, long after the
war had closed, that the forfeited lands of these masters would
be divided among them. It was only after earnest and persistent
efforts on the part of the officers of the Bureau, to convince
them that this hope was futile, that they finally abandoned
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But by this time it had become known among the freed people
of South Carolina and Georgia, that extensive tracts of
land on the coast of these States had been set aside by military
authority for their use. There the forty thousand bondmen
who followed Sherman out of Georgia, together with other
thousands who had preceded them, or come after, were established
upon independent farms, in self-governing communities
from which all white intruders were excluded. These settlements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>were chiefly upon the rich and delightful Sea Islands,
which the Rebel owners had abandoned, and which now became
the paradise of the freedmen’s hopes. “Go there,” they
said, “and every man can pick out his lot of forty acres, and
have it secured to him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With such fancies in his brain, the negro of the interior
was not likely to remain contented on the old plantation, after
learning that no acre of it was to be given him. He was naturally
averse to accepting a white master, when he might be
his own master elsewhere. His imaginative soul sang too, in
its rude way:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, had we some sweet little isle of our own,</div>
      <div class='line'>In a blue summer ocean, far off and alone!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And so the emigration to the coast set in.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1865, orders were issued that no more allotments
of land should be made to the Freedmen. But this did
not avail to stop entirely the tide of emigration; nor did it
inspire with contentment those who remained in the interior.
“If a freedman has forty acres on the coast,” they reasoned,
“why shouldn’t we have as much here?” Hence one of the
most serious troubles the officers of the Bureau had to contend
against.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, General Howard visited the Sea Islands with
the intention of restoring to the pardoned owners the lands on
which freedmen had been settled, under General Sherman’s
order. According to the President’s theory, a pardon entitled
the person pardoned to the immediate restoration of his property.
Hence arose a conflict of authority and endless confusion.
Secretary Stanton had approved of Sherman’s order,
and earnestly advised the freedmen to secure homesteads under
the government’s protection. General Saxton, Assistant
Commissioner of the Bureau, had in every way encouraged
them to do the same. So had General Hunter. Chief Justice
Chase had given them similar counsel. General Howard
found the land-owners urgent in pressing their claims,
and the freedmen equally determined in resisting them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>Impressed by the immense difficulty of the problem, he postponed
its immediate solution by a compromise, leaving the
main question to be settled by Congress. Congress settled it,
after a fashion, in the provisions of the Freedmen’s Bureau
Bill; but that, in consequence of the President’s veto, did not
become a law.</p>

<p class='c000'>By General Howard’s plan, abandoned lands on which there
were no freedmen settled under Sherman’s order, or only “a
few,” were to be restored to pardoned owners. Other estates,
on which there were more than “a few,” were also to be
restored, provided arrangements could be made, satisfactory to
both the owners and the freedmen. So nothing was settled.
The owners claimed the lands, and wished the freedmen to
make contracts to work for them. The freedmen claimed the
lands, and positively refused to make contracts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen’s crops for the past year had generally proved
failures, or nearly so. Their friends argued that this result
was owing to causes that could not be controlled,—the lack
of capital, of seed, of mules and farming implements, and
the lateness of the season when most of them commenced
work. The owners of the lands contended that the negro,
under the best conditions, could not make a crop of cotton.
The truth probably lies between these two extremes. The
freedmen lacked experience in management, as well as planting
capital; and I have no doubt but many of them thought
more of a gun and a fishing-rod, sources of a pleasure so new
to them, than of hard work in the field, which was anything
but a novelty.</p>

<p class='c000'>I regret to add that the freedmen’s prospects for the coming
year did not appear flattering. The uncertainty of their titles
caused them deep trouble and discouragement, and they did
not exhibit much energy in improving lands which might be
taken from them at any moment. The feeling, “This is my
home and my children’s,” seemed no longer to inspire them.
The majority were at work; but others were sullenly waiting
to see what the government would do.</p>

<p class='c000'>This whole question is one of great embarrassment and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>difficulty, and it is not easy to say how it should be decided.
The plan proposed by Congress, of securing to the freedmen
the possession of the lands for three years, did not seem to me
a very wise one. It would take them about three years,
under the most favorable circumstances, to overcome the obstacles
against which their poverty and inexperience would
have to struggle; and the knowledge that, after all, those
homes were not to be permanently their own, would tend to
discourage industry and promote vagabondism. It would be
better to remove them at once, if they are to be removed at
all; but then the question presents itself, can a great and magnanimous
government afford to break its pledges to these helpless
and unfortunate people?</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, to make their titles perpetual, is to give
over to uncertain cultivation, by a race supposed to exist only
for the convenience of another, the most valuable cotton-lands
of those States,—for it is here alone that the incomparable
long-fibred “Sea-Island” staple is produced,—a conclusion
deemed inadmissible and monstrous, especially by the Rebel
owners of the lands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>A VISIT TO JAMES ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A company of South Carolina planters, who were going
over to look at their estates on James Island, and learn if any
arrangements could be made with the freedmen, invited me to
accompany them; and on the morning of the day appointed,
I left my hotel for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding I was too early for the boat, I took a stroll along
the wharves, and visited the colonies of homeless plantation
negroes who had sought shelter under the open coal-sheds.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were at that time in Charleston fifteen hundred freed
people of this class waiting for transportation back to their
former homes, or to the plantations of new masters who had
hired them. A more wretched and pitiable herd of human
beings I never saw; nor had I witnessed anything like it out
of South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>Families were cooking and eating their breakfasts around
smoky fires. On all sides were heaps of their humble household
goods,—tubs, pails, pots and kettles, sacks, beds, barrels
tied up in blankets, boxes, baskets, bundles. They had
brought their live-stock with them; hens were scratching,
pigs squealing, cocks crowing, and starved puppies whining.</p>

<p class='c000'>One colony was going to Beaufort. “Mosser told we to
go back. We’se no money, and we’se glad to git on gov’ment
kindness, to git off.” But the government was not yet
ready to send them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many seemed deeply to regret that they were so much
trouble to the government. “We wants to git away to work
on our own hook. It’s not a good time at all here. We does
nothing but suffer from smoke and ketch cold. We wants to
begin de planting business.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>Another colony had been two weeks waiting for transportation
back to their old homes in Colleton District. Their
sufferings were very great. Said an old woman, with a shawl
over her head: “De jew and de air hackles we more’n anyting.
De rain beats on we, and de sun shines we out. My
chil’n so hungry dey can’t hole up. De Gov’ment, he han’t
gib we nottin’. Said dey would put we on board Saturday.
Some libs and some dies. If dey libs dey libs, and if dey dies
dey dies.” Such was her dim philosophy. I tried to converse
with others, who spoke a wild jargon peculiar to the plantations,
of which I understood hardly one word in ten.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Scott, who had recently succeeded General Saxton
as Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau in South Carolina,
was hastening measures for the relief of these poor people,
and to prevent any more from coming to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>I walked around by the delightful residences on East Bay
and South Bay, commanding fine views of the harbor and
Ashley River; and reached the wharf from which we were
to embark.</p>

<p class='c000'>Opposite lay James Island, with its marshy borders, and its
dark-green line of pines. Boats—mostly huge cypress dug-outs,
manned by negroes—were passing to and fro, some
coming from the island with loads of wood, others returning,
heavily laden, with families of freedmen going to their new
homes, and with household goods and supplies.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is interesting,” said one of the planters, whom I
found in waiting. “That wood comes from our plantations.
The negroes cut it off, bring it over to the city, and perhaps
sell it to the actual owners of the land they have taken it
from. We are buying our own wood of the darkey squatters.
The negroes are still going to the island, picking their lands,
and staking out forty-acre lots, though the Bureau is giving
no more titles.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A large cypress dug-out came to the wharf, rowed by a
black man and his son.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These boats all belonged to the planters, till the negroes
took possession of them. Now a man has to hire a passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>in his own canoe, and like as any way of one of his own
negroes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The grim, silent boatman seemed to understand well that
he was master of the situation. There were seven individuals
in our party, and his charge for taking us over to the Island
and back was ten dollars. He made no words about it: we
could accept his terms, or find another boat. The gravity
and taciturnity of this man indicated decided character, and
no mean capacity for self-ownership. As he and his son rowed
us across the river, he attended strictly to his business, hearing
the talk of the planters about the race he represented—talk
by no means complimentary—with an impenetrability of
countenance quite astonishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the third visit of the planters to the island, since
the war. On the first occasion, they were met by a party of
negroes, about forty in number, who rushed down to the landing,
armed with guns, and drove them away, with threats to
kill them if they came to disturb them in their homes again;
whereupon they discreetly withdrew. On their second visit
they were accompanied by Captain Ketchum, special agent of
the Bureau for the Sea Islands, to whose influence they probably
owed their lives. They were met as before, surrounded
by fierce black faces and levelled guns, captured, and not permitted
to regain their boat until their leaders, who could read
a little, became satisfied, from an examination of the Captain’s
papers, that he was an officer of the government. “We
are ready to do anything for gov’ment,” they said. “But we
have nothing to do with these men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They asked the Captain, who were the real owners of the
land,—they who had been placed there by the government, or
the planters who had been fighting against the government?</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is uncertain,” replied the conscientious Captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The planters, who had hoped for a different reply, well
aware that the negroes could not be brought to terms without
a positive assurance from an officer of the Bureau that they
had no good title to the lands, were very much disgusted.
“We may as well go back now,” said they. And scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>any effort was made to induce the negroes to abandon their
claims and make contracts.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was now their third visit, and it remained to be seen
how they would be received. We rowed a short distance
down Wappoo Creek, which separates the island from the
main land, and disembarked at a plantation belonging to three
orphan children, whose guardian was a member of our party.
The freedmen, having learned that the mere presence of the
planters on the soil could effect nothing, had changed their
tactics, and now not one of them was to be seen. Although
there were twenty-two hundred on the island, it appeared as
solitary and silent as if it had not an inhabitant.</p>

<p class='c000'>We found the plantation house occupied as head-quarters
by an officer of the Bureau, recently sent to the island. The
guardian of the three orphans took me aside, showed me the
desolated grounds without, shaded by magnificent live-oaks,
and the deserted chambers within.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can understand my feelings coming here,” he said.
“My sister expired in this room. She left her children to
me. This estate, containing seventeen hundred acres, and
worth fifty thousand dollars, is all that remains to them; and
you see the condition it is in. Why does the Government of
the United States persist in robbing orphan children? They
have done nothing; they haven’t earned the titles of Rebels
and traitors. Why not give them back their land?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I sympathized sincerely with this honest gentleman and his
orphan wards. “But you forget,” I said, “that such a war
as we have passed through cannot be, without involving in its
calamities the innocent as well as the rest. It would have
been well if that fact had not been overlooked in the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He made no reply. I afterwards learned from his friends
that he was one of the original and most fiery secessionists of
Charleston. He made a public speech, early in ’sixty-one,—printed
in the newspapers at the time,—in which he expressly
pledged his life and his fortune to the Confederate
cause. His life he had managed to preserve; and of his fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>sufficient remained for the elegant maintenance of his
own and his sister’s children; so that it appeared to me quite
unreasonable for him to complain of the misfortune which he
himself had been instrumental in bringing upon the orphans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party separated, each man going to look at his own
estate. I accompanied one who had three fine plantations in
the vicinity. A Northern man by birth, his sympathy had
been with the government, while he found his private interest
in working for the Confederate usurpation under profitable
contracts. By holding his tongue and attending to business
he had accumulated a handsome fortune,—wisely investing his
Confederate scrip in real estate, which he thought somewhat
more substantial. These plantations were a part of his earnings.
Being a Northern man, and at heart a Union man, he
deemed it hard that they should not be at once restored to
him. The fact that they were his reward for aiding the enemies
of his country,—rich gains, so to speak, snatched from
the wreck of a pirate ship on board which he had served,—did
not seem to have occurred to him as any bar to his claims.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first we found all the freedmen’s houses shut up, and as
silent as if the inhabitants had all gone to a funeral. By pressing
into some of them, we discovered a few women and children,
but the men had disappeared. Since they were not to
resist our coming, it seemed their policy to have nothing whatever
to do with us. At last we found an old negro too decrepit
to run away, who sullenly awaited our approach.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is your name, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Samuel Butler.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“From St. John.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you come here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yankees fotch me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t you want to go back to St. John?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yankees fotch me here,” repeated the old man, “and I
won’t go back widout de Yankees send me back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We inquired about his family and his prospects.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My chil’n ’s out in soldiering. I made corn, peas, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>potatoes, I got enough to carry me out de year. I had to
bought my own clo’es, besides. Gov’ment don’t help me none.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had his forty-acre lot, and would not peril his claim to it
by talking about a contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one cabin we found a very old negro lying on the floor,
miserably sick with the dropsy. He had been “a faithful old
family servant,” as the phrase is; and was accounted a wise
head by the planters. When asked if he thought the freedmen
could be prevailed upon to contract, he replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What little we do will be sarvice to we-self. We don’t
want to work for rest,”—meaning the planters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of himself, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“My time is all burnt out.” He said there was a heap of
idlers on the island. “Dey’m on a full spree now. Dey got
a sort of frolic in de brains.” There had been considerable
destitution even among the industrious ones the past year;
but many of them had made fair crops, and had corn sufficient
to keep them till another harvest. “Dey’m more situated
better now.” The small-pox had raged on the island, and “a
sight of our people had died.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We lingered at these cabins, waiting for a guard the officer
at head-quarters thought it prudent to send with us. At last
he arrived,—a shining black youngster in soldier-clothes, overflowing
with vanity and politeness. “I’m waiting on your
occupation, gentlemen,” he said; and we started on.</p>

<p class='c000'>We passed a field in which there were several women at
work. As they had no mule, they did everything by hand,
chopping up the turf and weeds with their great awkward
hoes, and scraping them, with the surface soil, into little ridges,
on which cotton or corn was to be planted. This process of
preparing the ground is called “listing”; it answers the purpose
of ploughing, and the refuse stuff scraped together, rotting,
serves instead of manure.</p>

<p class='c000'>My companion inquired on what terms they would consent
to give up their forty-acre lot. One of them, poising her
formidable hoe, replied in accents that carried conviction with
them:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>“Gov’ment drap we here. Can’t go ’till Gov’ment take
we off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As we were now proceeding to a more remote part of the
island, our colored guard walked proudly on to protect us from
danger. “Dey can’t make no raid on you, widout dey makes
raid on me fus’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He evidently felt himself vastly superior to these low-down
plantation niggers. And I noticed that when we stopped to
talk with any of them, and my friend recorded their names
and numbers, and I also took notes, this shining black fellow
in blue likewise produced a piece of card and a pencil, and
appeared to be writing down very interesting and amusing
memoranda.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mile or so from head-quarters we found negro men and
women working in the fields.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this your farm?” my friend inquired of one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I calls it mine. General Saxton told me to come and
stake out my forty acres, and he’d give me a ticket for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wouldn’t it be better for you to contract for good wages,
than to work in this way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, I don’t want to contract. I’ll eat up my corn and
peas fus’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you raise much last year?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I begun too late. Den de drought hit us bad. Heap of
places didn’t raise much. But I got a little.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Observing a strange looking thing of skin and bones standing
in the weeds, I asked, “Is that a horse?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat’s a piece o’ one. When he gits tired, I can take my
arms; I’ve good strong arms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon that one of the women struck in vehemently:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can plough land same as a hoss. Wid dese hands I
raise cotton dis year, buy two hosses!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the immense disadvantage under which these poor
people labored, without teams, without capital, and even without
security in the possession of their little homesteads, I urged
them to consider well what the planters had to offer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I contract, what good does my forty acres do me?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>“But you are not sure of your forty acres. This year or
next they may be given back to the former owner. Then you
will have nothing; for you will have spent all your time and
strength in trying to get a start. But if you work for wages,
you will have, if you are prudent, a hundred and fifty dollars
in clear cash at the end of the year. At that rate it will not
be long before you will be able to buy a little place and stock
it handsomely; when you will probably be much better off
than you would be working here in this way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I could see that this argument was not without its weight
with the men. They appeared troubled by it, but not convinced.
The women clamored against it, and almost made me
feel that I was an enemy, giving them insidious ill advice.
And when I saw the almost religious attachment of these people
to their homes, and their hope and ambition bearing up
resolutely against poverty and every discouragement, it would
have caused me a pang of remorse to know that I had persuaded
any of them to give up their humble but worthy and
honest aims. Then the children came around us, carrying
primers, out of which they read with pleased eagerness, either
for the fun of the thing, or to show us what they could do.
The parents, forgetting the disheartening words we had spoken,
said cheerily, “Richard, Helen, time for school!” and the
little ones scampered away; the older ones resumed their
work, and we walked on.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was pleased to see some of the forty-acre lots enclosed by
substantial new fences. But every question of benefit has two
sides. The other side to this was that the fine old plantation
shade-trees had been cut down and split into rails; a circumstance
which made my friend the planter look glum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The island is level, with handsome hedged avenues running
through it in various directions. It is nine miles in length and
three in breadth. We extended our walk as far as Fort Pemberton,
on Stono River, which bounded my friend’s plantations
in that direction. On our return, he thought he would try
one more freedman with the offer of a contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man was working with his wife on a little farm of indefinite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>extent. “I don’t know how much land I have. I
guessed off as near as I could forty acres.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said he had “a large fambly,” and that he came from
Charleston. “I heard there was a chance of we being our
own driver here; that’s why we come.” He could get along
very well if he only had a horse. “But if I can git de land,
I’ll take my chances.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if you can’t get the land?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If a man got to go crost de riber, and he can’t git a boat,
he take a log. If I can’t own de land, I’ll hire or lease
land, but I won’t contract.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, then,” said my friend, “we may as well go home.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>SHERMAN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“The march of the Federals into our State,” says a writer
in the “Columbia Phœnix,” “was characterized by such
scenes of license, plunder, and conflagration as very soon
showed that the threats of the Northern press, and of their
soldiery, were not to be regarded as a mere <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">brutum fulmen</span></i>.
Daily long trains of fugitives lined the roads, with wives and
children, and horses and stock and cattle, seeking refuge from
the pursuers. Long lines of wagons covered the highways.
Half-naked people cowered from the winter under bush-tents
in the thickets, under the eaves of houses, under the railroad
sheds, and in old cars left them along the route. All these
repeated the same story of suffering, violence, poverty, and
nakedness. Habitation after habitation, village after village,—one
sending up its signal flames to the other, presaging for it
the same fate,—lighted the winter and midnight sky with
crimson horrors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No language can describe, nor can any catalogue furnish,
an adequate detail of the wide-spread destruction of homes
and property. Granaries were emptied, and where the grain
was not carried off, it was strewn to waste under the feet of
the cavalry, or consigned to the fire which consumed the dwelling.
The negroes were robbed equally with the whites of
food and clothing. The roads were covered with butchered
cattle, hogs, mules, and the costliest furniture. Valuable cabinets,
rich pianos, were not only hewn to pieces, but bottles of
ink, turpentine, oil, whatever could efface or destroy, were
employed to defile and ruin. Horses were ridden into the
houses. People were forced from their beds, to permit the
search after hidden treasures.</p>

<img src='images/i_547.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>“The beautiful homesteads of the parish country, with their
wonderful tropical gardens, were ruined; ancient dwellings of
black cypress, one hundred years old, which had been reared
by the fathers of the Republic,—men whose names were famous
in Revolutionary history,—were given to the torch as
recklessly as were the rude hovels; choice pictures and works
of art from Europe, select and numerous libraries, objects of
peace wholly, were all destroyed. The inhabitants, black no
less than white, were left to starve, compelled to feed only
upon the garbage to be found in the abandoned camps of the
soldiers. The corn scraped up from the spots where the horses
fed, has been the only means of life left to thousands but lately
in affluence. The villages of Buford’s Bridge, of Barnwell,
Blackville, Graham’s, Bamberg, Midway, were more or less
destroyed; the inhabitants everywhere left homeless and without
food. The horses and mules, all cattle and hogs, whenever
fit for service or for food, were carried off, and the rest
shot. Every implement of the workman or the farmer, tools,
ploughs, hoes, gins, looms, wagons, vehicles, was made to feed
the flames.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing northward through the State, by the way of Orangeburg,
Columbia, and Winnsboro’, I heard, all along the route,
stories corroborative of the general truthfulness of this somewhat
highly colored picture. The following, related to me
by a lady residing in Orangeburg District, will serve as a
sample of these detailed narratives.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The burning of the bridges by the Confederates, as the
Yankees were chasing them, did no good, but a deal of harm.
They couldn’t stop such an army as Sherman’s, but all they
could do was to hinder it, and keep it a few days longer in the
country, eating us up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was the best disciplined army in the world. At sundown,
not a soldier was to be seen, and you could rest in
peace till morning. That convinces me that everything that
was done was permitted, if not ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had an old cook with me,—one of the best old creatures
you ever saw. She had a hard master before we bought her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>and she carried the marks on her face and hands where he had
thrown knives at her. Such treatment as she got from us was
something new to her; and there was nothing she wouldn’t
do for us, in return.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’For heaven’s sake, missus,’ says she, ‘bury some flour
for the chil’n!’ I gave her the keys to the smoke-house, and
told her to do what she pleased. ‘Send all the niggers off the
place but me and my son,’ she says, ‘for I don’t trust ’em.’
Then she and her son buried two barrels of flour, the silver
pitcher and goblets, and a box of clothes. But that night she
dreamed that the Yankees came and found the place; so the
next morning she went and dug up all the things but the
flour, which she hadn’t time to remove, and buried them
under the hog-pen. Sure enough, when the Yankees came,
they found the flour, but her dream saved the rest. She was
afraid they would get hold of her son, and make him tell, so
she kept him in the chimney-corner, right under her eyes, all
day, pretending he was sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some of the negroes were very much excited by the Yankees’
coming. One of our black girls jumped up and shouted,
‘Glory to God! de Yankees is comin’ to marry all we niggers!’
But they generally behaved very well. A black man
named Charles, belonging to one of our neighbors, started
with a load of goods, and flanked the Yankees for three days,
and eluded them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A good many houses were burned in our neighborhood.
Some that were occupied were set on fire two or three times,
and the inhabitants put them out. The Yankees set the woods
on fire, and we should have all been burnt up, if our negroes
hadn’t dug trenches to keep the flames from reaching the
buildings. General Sherman and his staff stopped at the
house of a man of the name of Walker, in Barnwell District.
While Mr. Walker was thanking him for protecting his property,
he turned around, and saw the house on fire. General
Sherman was very indignant. Said he, ‘If I could learn who
did that, he should meet with condign punishment!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The foragers broke down all the broadside of our barn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>and let the corn out; then they broke down all the broadside
of the garden, and drove in. We had three hundred bushels
of corn; and they took all but fifty bushels; they told me to
hide that away. We had three barrels of syrup, and they
took all but one gallon. They took eight thousand pounds of
fodder, and three barrels of flour, all we had. We had twelve
hundred pounds of bacon, and the soldiers took all but three
pieces, which they said they left for the rest to take. We had
twelve bushels of rough-rice; they left us three; and afterwards
soldiers came in and threw shot in it, and mixed all up
with sugar.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They loaded up our old family carriage with bacon and
sweet potatoes, and drove it away,—and that hurt me worse
than all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They took our last potatoes. Three or four had just been
roasted for the children: ‘Damn the children!’ they said;
and they ate the potatoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Out of forty hogs, they left us six. We had twenty-one
head of cattle, and they left us five. The officers were very
kind to us, and if we could have had them with us all the
time, we should have saved a good deal of stuff. One Yankee
lieutenant was with us a good deal, and he was just like a
brother to me. He reprimanded the soldiers who spoke saucily
to us, telling them to remember that they had mothers and
sisters at home. He wanted me to put out a white flag, because
my husband is a Northern man. But I said, ‘I’ll see
this house torn to pieces first, for I’m as good a Rebel as any
of them!’ He took three wagon-loads of corn from us: I
thought that was mighty hard, if he cared anything for me.”
It was he, however, who left her the fifty bushels, which nobody
took.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The soldiers were full of fun and mischief. Says one,
‘I’m going to the smoke-house, to sweeten my mouth with
molasses, and then I’m coming in to kiss these dumb perty
girls.’ They emptied out the molasses, then walked through
it, and tracked it all over the house. They dressed up their
horses in women’s clothes. They tore up our dresses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>tied them to their horses’ tails. They dressed up the negroes
that followed them. They strung cow-bells all around their
horses and cattle. They killed chickens and brought them
into the house on their bayonets, all dripping.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two came into the house drunk, and ordered the old cook
to get them some dinner. She told them we had nothing left.
‘Go and kill a weasel!’ said they. She boiled them some
eggs. They took one, and peeled it, and gave it to my little
boy. ‘Here, eat that!’ said one. ‘But I’ve a good mind to
blow your brains out, for you’re a d——d little Rebel.’ This
man was from Connecticut, a native of the same town my
husband came from. It would have been curious if they had
met, and found that they were old acquaintances!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some behaved very well. One was handling the fancy
things on the what-not, when another said, ‘It won’t help crush
the Rebellion to break them.’ ‘I ain’t going to break them,’
he said, and he didn’t.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My husband had moved up a large quantity of crockery
and glass-ware from his store in Charleston, for safety. The
Yankees smashed it all. They wouldn’t stop for keys, but
broke open every drawer and closet. There wasn’t a lock left
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For three nights we never lay down at all. I just sat
one side of the fireplace and another young lady the other,
thinking what had happened during the day, and wondering
what dreadful things would come next.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She had helped me bury three boxes of silver in the
cellar. The soldiers were all around them, and afterwards I
found one of the boxes sticking out; but they didn’t find them.
When they asked me for my silver I thought I’d lie once, and
I told them I had none. ‘It’s a lie,’ says one. Then the old
cook’s son spoke up, ‘Take the word of a slave; she’s nothing
buried.’ On that they stopped looking.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some of the officers had colored girls with them. One
stopped over night with his miss at the house of one of our
neighbors. When they came down stairs in the morning, she
was dressed up magnificently in Mrs. J——’s best clothes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>They ordered breakfast; while they were eating, the last of
the army passed on, and they were left behind. ‘Captain,’
says she, ‘aint ye wery wentur’some?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“When one division was plundering us, the men would say,
‘We’re nothing; but if such a division comes along, you’re
gone up.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides the fifty bushels of corn the lieutenant left us, I
don’t think there were fifty bushels in the whole district. Our
neighbors were jealous because we had been treated so much
better than they. The Yankees didn’t leave enough for the
children to eat, nor dishes to eat off of. Those who managed
to save a little corn or a few potatoes, shared with the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We thought we were served badly enough. Of all my
bedding, I had but two sheets and a pillow-case left. The
Yankees didn’t spare us a hat or a coat. They even took the
children’s clothes. We hadn’t a comb or a brush for our
heads the next day, nor a towel for our hands. But, after all
is said about Sherman’s army, I confess some of our own
soldiers, especially Wheeler’s men, were about as bad.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never gave the negroes a single order, but they went to
work, after the Yankees had passed, and cleared up the whole
place. They took corn and ground it; and they went to the
Yankee camp for meat, and cooked it for us. Our horses were
taken, but they planted rice and corn with their hoes. There
were scarcely any white men in the country. Most were in
the army; and the Yankees took prisoners all who came under
the conscript act. They carried some away who have never
been heard from since.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My husband was in Charleston, and for weeks neither of
us knew if the other was alive. I walked seventeen miles to
mail a letter to him. The old cook went with me and carried
my child. From seven in the morning until dark, the first
day, I walked twelve miles; and five the next. The old cook
didn’t feel tired a bit, though she carried the baby; but she
kept saying to me, ‘Do don’t set down dar, missus; we’ll
neber git dar!’ We were two days coming home again.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BURNING OF COLUMBIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“It has pleased God,” says the writer in the “Daily Phœnix,”
already quoted, “to visit our beautiful city with the most cruel
fate which can ever befall states or cities. He has permitted
an invading army to penetrate our country almost without
impediment; to rob and ravage our dwellings, and to commit
three fifths of our city to the flames. Eighty-four squares, out
of one hundred and twenty-four which the city contains, have
been destroyed, with scarcely the exception of a single house.
The ancient capitol building of the State—that venerable
structure, which, for seventy years, has echoed with the eloquence
and wisdom of the most famous statesmen—is laid in
ashes; six temples of the Most High God have shared the
same fate; eleven banking establishments; the schools of learning,
the shops of art and trade, of invention and manufacture;
shrines equally of religion, benevolence, and industry; are all
buried together, in one congregated ruin. Humiliation spreads
her ashes over our homes and garments, and the universal
wreck exhibits only one common aspect of despair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Columbia, the proud capital of the proudest State in the
Union,—who ever supposed that <em>she</em> could be destined to such
a fate? Who ever imagined that in <em>this</em> way that fine bird,
secession, would come home to roost?</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost until the last moment the people of South Carolina,
relying upon the immense prestige of their little State sovereignty,
even after the State was invaded, believed that the
capital was safe. Already, during the war, thousands of citizens
from Charleston and other places, in order to avoid the
possibility of danger, had sought the retirement of its beautiful
shady streets and supposed impregnable walls. The population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>of Columbia had thus increased, in two or three years,
from fourteen thousand to thirty-seven thousand. Then
Sherman appeared, driving clouds of fugitives before him into
the city. Still the inhabitants cherished their delusion, until
it was dispelled by the sound of the Federal cannon at their
gates. The Confederate troops fell back into the city, followed
by bursting shells.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then commenced the usual scenes of panic. “Terrible was
the press, the shock, the rush, the hurry, the universal confusion—such
as might naturally be looked for, in the circumstances
of a city from which thousands were preparing to fly,
without previous preparations for flight, burdened with pale
and trembling women, their children and portable chattels,
trunks and jewels, family Bibles and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">lares familiares</span></i>. The
railroad depot for Charlotte was crowded with anxious waiters
upon the train, with a wilderness of luggage, millions, perhaps,
in value, much of which was left finally and lost. Throughout
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, these scenes of struggle
were in constant performance. The citizens fared badly.
The Governments of the State and of the Confederacy absorbed
all the modes of conveyance. Transportation about the
city could not be had, save by a rich or favored few. No love
could persuade where money failed to convince, and <span class='fss'>SELF</span>,
growing bloated in its dimensions, stared from every hurrying
aspect, as you traversed the excited and crowded streets.
In numerous instances, those who succeeded in getting away,
did so at the cost of trunks and luggage; and, under what
discomfort they departed, no one who did not see can readily
conceive.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Numbers of the poorer classes took advantage of this confusion
to plunder the city. On Friday morning, they broke
into the South Carolina Railroad Depot, which was “crowded
with the stores of merchants and planters, trunks of treasure,
innumerable wares and goods of fugitives, all of great value.
It appears that among its contents were some kegs of powder.
The plunderers paid, and suddenly, the penalties of their crime.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>Using their lights freely and hurriedly, they fired a train of
powder leading to the kegs.” A fearful explosion followed,
destructive to property and life.<a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Early on Friday the Confederate quartermaster and commissary
stores were thrown open to the people. Old men,
women, children, and negroes, loaded themselves with plunder.
Wheeler’s cavalry rushed in for their share, and several troopers
were seen riding off “with huge bales of cotton on their
saddles.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The same day—Friday, February 17th—Sherman entered
Columbia. To the anxious mayor he said: “Not a
finger’s breadth of your city shall be harmed. You may lie
down and sleep, satisfied that your town will be as safe in my
hands as in your own.” That night Columbia was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is still a question, who is responsible for this calamity.
General Sherman denies that he authorized it, and we are
bound to believe him. But did he not permit it? or was it
not in his power at least to have prevented it? General
Howard is reported to have said to a clergyman of the place,
that no orders were given to burn Columbia, but the soldiers
had got the impression that its destruction would be acceptable
at head-quarters. Were the soldiers correct in their impression?</p>

<p class='c000'>A member of General Sherman’s staff speaks thus of the
origin of the fire:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite sure that it originated in sparks flying from
the hundreds of bales of cotton which the Rebels had placed
along the middle of the main street, and fired as they left the
city. Fire from a tightly compressed bale of cotton is unlike
that of a more open material, which burns itself out. The
fire lies smouldering in a bale of cotton long after it appears
to be extinguished; and in this instance, when our soldiers
supposed they had extinguished the fire, it suddenly broke out
again with the most disastrous effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There were fires, however, which must have been started
independent of the above-named cause. The source of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>is ascribed to the desire for revenge from some two hundred
of our prisoners, who had escaped from the cars as they were
being conveyed from this city to Charlotte, and with the memories
of long sufferings in the miserable pens I visited yesterday
on the other side of the river, sought this means of retaliation.
Again it is said that the soldiers who first entered the
town, intoxicated with success and a liberal supply of bad
liquor, which was freely distributed among them by designing
citizens, in an insanity of exhilaration set fire to unoccupied
houses.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is also probable that fires were set by citizen marauders.
But is this the whole truth with regard to the burning of
Columbia?</p>

<p class='c000'>I visited the place nearly a year after its great disaster,
when the passions of men had had time to cool a little.
Through the courtesy of Governor Orr I made acquaintance
with prominent and responsible citizens. To these gentlemen—especially
to Mr. J. G. Gibbes, the present mayor of the
city—I am indebted for the following statements and anecdotes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the evening, as the inhabitants, quieted by General
Sherman’s assurance, were about retiring to their beds, a
rocket went up in the lower part of the city. Another in the
centre, and a third in the upper part of the town, succeeded.
Dr. R. W. Gibbes, father of the present mayor, was in the
street talking, near one of the Federal guards, who exclaimed,
on seeing the signals, “My God! I pity your city!” Mr.
Goodwyn, who was mayor at the time, reports a similar remark
from an Iowa soldier. “Your city is doomed! These
rockets are the signal!” Immediately afterwards fires broke
out in twenty different places.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dwellings of Secretary Trenholm and General Wade
Hampton were among the first to burst into flames. Soldiers
went from house to house, spreading the conflagration. Fireballs,
composed of cotton saturated with turpentine, were
thrown in at doors and windows. Many houses were entered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>and fired by means of combustible liquids poured upon beds
and clothing, and ignited by wads of burning cotton, or
matches from a soldier’s pocket. The fire department came
out in force, but the hose-pipes were cut to pieces and the
men driven from the streets. At the same time universal
plundering and robbery began.</p>

<p class='c000'>The burning of the house of Dr. R. W. Gibbes,—an eminent
physician, well-known to the scientific world,—was thus
described to me by his son:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“He had a guard at the front door; but some soldiers
climbed in at the rear of the house, got into the parlor,
heaped together sheets, poured turpentine over them, piled
chairs on them, and set them on fire. As he remonstrated
with them, they laughed at him. The guard at the front
door could do nothing, for if he left his post, other soldiers
would come in that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The guard had a disabled foot, and my father had dressed
it for him. He appeared very grateful for the favor, and
earnestly advised my father to save his valuables. The house
was full of costly paintings, and curiosities of art and natural
history, and my father did not know what to save and what
to leave behind. He finally tied up in a bedquilt a quantity
of silver and gems. As he was going out of the door,—the
house was already on fire behind him,—the guard said, ‘Is
that all you can save?’ ‘It is all I can well carry,’ said my
father. ‘Leave that with me,’ said the guard; ‘I will take
charge of it, while you go back and get another bundle.’ My
father thought he was very kind. He went back for another
bundle, and while he was gone, the guard ran off with his
lame leg and all the gems and silver.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of Mr. Gibbes’s neighbors, a widow lady, had an
equally conscientious guard. He said to her, “I can guard
the front of the house, but not the rear; and if you have
anything valuable buried you had better look after it.” She
threw up her hands and exclaimed, “O, my silver and my
fine old wine, buried under that peach-tree!” The guard
immediately called a squad of men, and told them to respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>the widow lady’s wine and silver, buried under that peach-tree.
He went with them, and they dug a little to see if the
treasures were safe. Finding the wine, they tasted it to see
if it merited the epithet “fine old.” Discovering that it did,
they showed their approbation of her good sense and truthfulness
by drinking it up. They then carried off the silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soldiers, in their march through Georgia, and thus far
into South Carolina, had acquired a wonderful skill in finding
treasures. They had two kinds of “divining-rods,” negroes,
and bayonets. What the unfaithful servants of the rich failed
to reveal, the other instruments, by thorough and constant
practice, were generally able to discover. On the night of
the fire, a thousand men could be seen, in the yards and gardens
of Columbia, by the glare of the flames, probing the
earth with bayonets. “Not one twentieth part of the articles
buried in this city escaped them,” Mr. Gibbes assured me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire was seen at immense distances. A gentleman
living eighty-five miles north of Columbia, told me he could
see to read in his garden that night by the light it gave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dismay and terror of the inhabitants can scarcely be
conceived. They had two enemies, the fire in their houses
and the soldiery without. Many who attempted to bear away
portions of their goods were robbed by the way. Trunks and
bundles were snatched from the hands of hurrying fugitives,
broken open, rifled, and then hurled into the flames. Ornaments
were plucked from the necks and arms of ladies, and
caskets from their hands. Even children and negroes were
robbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately the streets of Columbia were broad, else many
of the fugitives must have perished in the flames which met
them on all sides. The exodus of homeless families, flying
between walls of fire, was a terrible and piteous spectacle. I
have already described a similar scene in a Reminiscence of
Chambersburg, and shall not dwell upon this. The fact that
these were the wives and children and flaming homes of our
enemies, does not lessen the feeling of sympathy for the sufferers.
Some fled to the parks; others to the open ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>without the city; numbers sought refuge in the graveyards.
Isolated and unburned dwellings were crowded to excess with
fugitives. “On Saturday morning,” said Mayor Gibbes,
“there were two hundred women and children in this house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Three fifths of the city in bulk, and four fifths in value, were
destroyed. The loss of property is estimated at thirty millions.
No more respect seems to have been shown for buildings commonly
deemed sacred, than for any others. The churches
were pillaged, and afterwards burned. St. Mary’s College, a
Catholic institution, shared their fate. The Catholic Convent,
to which had been confided for safety many young ladies, not
nuns, and stores of treasure, was ruthlessly sacked. The soldiers
drank the sacramental wine, and profaned with fiery
draughts of vulgar whiskey the goblets of the communion service.
Some went off reeling under the weight of priestly
robes, holy vessels, and candlesticks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not even the Masonic and Odd Fellow lodges were spared.
Afterwards tipsy soldiers were seen about the streets dressed
up in the regalias of these orders. The sword of state, belonging
to the Grand Lodge of South Carolina, a massy, curious,
two-edged weapon, of considerable antiquity, was among
the objects stolen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The buildings and library of South Carolina College were
saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not much drunkenness was observed among the soldiers
until after the sacking of the city had been some time in progress.
Then the stores of liquors consumed exhibited their
natural effect; and it is stated that many perished in fires of
their own kindling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the army of Sherman did not, in its wildest orgies, forget
its splendid discipline. “When will these horrors cease?”
asked a lady of an officer at her house. “You will hear the
bugles at sunrise,” he replied; “then they will cease, and not
till then.” He prophesied truly. “At daybreak, on Saturday
morning,” said Mayor Gibbes, “I saw two men galloping
through the streets, blowing horns. Not a dwelling was fired
after that; immediately the town became quiet.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>Robberies, however, did not cease with the night. Watches
and money continued to be in demand. A soldier would ask
a citizen the time. If the latter was so imprudent as to produce
his watch, it was instantly snatched. “A very pretty
watch that; I’ll take it, if you please,” was the usual remark
accompanying the act.</p>

<p class='c000'>One old gentleman who had purchased two watches for his
grandchildren, lost one in this way. In his rage and grief he
exclaimed, “You may as well take the other!” And his
suggestion was cheerfully complied with.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another sufferer said, “That watch will be good for nothing
without the key. Won’t you stop and take it?” “Thank
you,” said the soldier; and he went off, proudly winding his
new chronometer.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few saved their watches by the use of a little artifice.
“What’s the time?” cried a soldier, stopping a ready-witted
gentleman. “You’re too late; I was just asked that question,”
was the opportune reply. Another looked up where the
city hall clock stood until brought down by the fire, and replied
to the question of time, “The clock has been burned, you
see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The women of Columbia have the credit of exhibiting great
courage and presence of mind, under these trying circumstances.
Occasionally, however, they were taken by surprise.
I have related how one lady lost her silver and fine old wine.
Another was suddenly accosted by a soldier who thrust his
revolver under her bonnet: “Your money! your watch!”
“O, my soul!” she exclaimed, “I have no watch, no money,
except what’s tied ’round my waist!” “I’ll relieve you of
that,” said the soldier, ripping up her stays with his knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soldiers were full of cheerful remarks about the fire.
“What curious people you are!” said one, looking at the
ruins. “You run up your chimneys before you build your
houses.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Although some of the guards were faithless, others—and I
hope a majority of them—executed their trust with fidelity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some curious incidents occurred. One man’s treasure, concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>by his garden fence, escaped the soldiers’ divining-rods,
but was afterwards discovered by a hitched horse pawing the
earth from the buried box. Some hidden guns had defied
the most diligent search, until a chicken, chased by a soldier,
ran into a hole beneath a house. The soldier, crawling after,
and putting in his hand for the chicken, found the guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>A soldier, passing in the streets, and seeing some children
playing with a beautiful little greyhound, amused himself by
beating its brains out. Another soldier with a kinder heart,
to comfort them, told them not to cry, and proposed to have a
funeral over the remains of their little favorite. He put it in
a box, and went to bury it in the garden, directly <em>on the spot
where the family treasures were concealed</em>. The proprietor, in
great distress of mind, watched the proceedings, fearful of
exciting suspicion if he opposed it, and trembling lest each
thrust of the spade should reveal the secret. A corner of the
box was actually laid bare, when, kicking some dirt over it, he
said, “There, that will do, children!” and hastened the burial.
The soldier no doubt thought he betrayed a good deal of emotion
at the grave of a lap-dog. The hole was filled up, but
the danger was not yet over, for there was a chance that the
next soldier who came that way might be attracted by the
fresh-looking earth, and go to digging.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some treasures were buried in cemeteries, but they did not
always escape the search of the soldiers, who showed a strong
mistrust of new-made graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is curious to consider what has become of all the jewels
and finery of which our armies robbed the people of the South.
On two or three occasions gentlemen of respectability have
shown me, with considerably more pride than I could have
felt under the circumstances, vases and trinkets which they
“picked up when they were in the army.” Some of these
curiosities have been heard from by their rightful owners. A
ring, worn by a lady of Philadelphia, was last summer recognized
by a Southern gentleman, who remarked that he thought
he had seen it before. “Very possibly,” was the reply; “it
was given me by Captain ——, of General Sherman’s staff;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>and it was presented to him by a lady of Columbia for his
efforts in saving her property.” But the lady of Columbia,
who knew nothing of any such efforts in her behalf, avers that
the gallant captain stole the ring.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Minegault, daughter of the late Judge Huger, of
Charleston,—the same gentleman who was associated with
Dr. Bollmann in the attempted rescue of Lafayette from the
dungeons of Olmütz,—while on a visit to New York last summer,
was one Sunday morning kneeling in Grace Church,
when she saw upon the fair shoulders of a lady kneeling before
her, a shawl which had been lost when her plantation, between
Charleston and Savannah, was plundered by the Federals.
Her attention being thus singularly attracted, she next observed
on the lady’s arm a bracelet which was taken from her
at the same time. This was to her a very precious souvenir,
for it had been presented to her by her father, and it contained
his picture. The services ended, she followed the lady home,
and rang at the door immediately after she had entered. Asking
to see the lady of the house, she was shown into the parlor,
and presently the lady appeared, with the shawl upon her
shoulders and the bracelet on her arm. Frankly the visitor
related the story of the bracelet, and at once the wearer restored
it to her with ample apologies and regrets. The visitor,
quite overcome by this generosity, and delighted beyond measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>at the recovery of the bracelet, had not the heart to say a
word about the shawl, but left it in the possession of the innocent
wearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>I talked with some good Columbians who expressed the
most violent hatred of the Yankees, for the ruin of their
homes. Others took a more philosophical view of the subject.
This difference was thus explained to me by Governor Orr’s
private secretary, an intelligent young man, who had been an
officer in the Confederate service:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“People who were not in the war cannot understand or
forgive these things. But those who have been in the army
know what armies are; they know that, under the same circumstances,
they would have done the same things.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I also observed that those whose losses were greatest were
seldom those who complained most. Mayor Gibbes lost more
cotton than any other individual in the Confederacy. Sherman
burned for him two thousand and seven hundred bales,
besides mills and other property. Yet he spoke of these results
of the war without a murmur.</p>

<p class='c000'>He censured Sherman severely, however, for the destitution
in which he left the people of Columbia. “I called on him
to relieve the starving inhabitants he had burned out of their
homes. He gave us four hundred head of refuse cattle, but
he gave us nothing to feed them, and a hundred and sixty of
them died of starvation before they could be killed. For five
weeks afterwards, twenty-five hundred people around Columbia
lived upon nothing but loose grain picked up about the camps,
where the Federal horses had been fed. A stranger,” he
added, “cannot be made to understand the continued destitution
and poverty of the people of this district. If a tax should
now be assessed upon them of three dollars per head, there
would not be money enough in the district to pay it. Ordinarily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>our annual taxes in this city have been forty thousand
dollars. This year they have dropped down to eighteen hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>South Carolina College is a striking illustration of the effect
the war has had upon the institutions of learning at the South.
Formerly it had about two hundred and fifty students; it has
now but eighteen. The State appropriated annually sixty-five
thousand dollars for its benefit; this year a nominal appropriation
of eight thousand dollars was made, to pay the salaries
of the professors, but when I was in Columbia they had not
been able to get that. One, a gentleman of distinguished
learning, said he had not had ten dollars in his possession since
Sherman visited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the desolation and horrors our army left behind it, no
description can be given. Here is a single instance. At a
factory on the Congaree, just out of Columbia, there remained,
for six weeks, a pile of sixty-five dead horses and
mules, shot by Sherman’s men. It was impossible to bury
them, all the shovels, spades, and other farming implements
of the kind having been carried off or destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Columbia must have been a beautiful city, judged by its
ruins. The streets were broad and well shaded. Many fine
residences still remain on the outskirts, but the entire heart
of the city, within their circuit, is a wilderness of crumbling
walls, naked chimneys, and trees killed by the flames. The
fountains of the desolated gardens are dry, the basins cracked;
the pillars of the houses are dismantled, or overthrown; the
marble steps are broken; but all these attest the wealth and
elegance which one night of fire and orgies sufficed to destroy.
Fortunately the unfinished new State House, one of the handsomest
public edifices in the whole country, received but trifling
injury.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not much was doing to rebuild any but the business portion
of the city. Only on Main Street were there many stores or
shanties going up.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>NOTES ON SOUTH CAROLINA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At a distance from the Sea Islands, the free-labor system
in South Carolina, was fast settling down upon a satisfactory
basis. General Richardson, commanding the Eastern District
of the State,—comprising all the districts east of the Wateree
and Santee, except Georgetown and Horry, on the coast,—assured
me that there was going to be more cotton raised in
those districts this year than ever before.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the districts west of the Wateree, the soil is not so well
adapted to cotton, and the country abounds in ignorant small
planters and poor whites. A planter of the average class, in
York District, said to me: “The people of this country formerly
lived on nigger-raising. That was the crop we depended
on. If we could raise corn and pork enough to feed
the niggers, we did well. Now this great staple is tuk from
us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The planters here love to dwell upon the advantages they
derived from that crop. One said to me; “Let a young man
take three likely gals, set ’em to breedin’ right away, and he
mought make a fortune out on ’em, ’fore he was old. But
them times is past.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The winds of freedom had scarcely reached the more remote
western districts. A planter of Union District told me
that he was hiring good men for twenty-five dollars a year.
“Heap on ’em, round here, just works for their victuals and
clothes, like they always did. I reckon they’ll all be back
whar they was, in a few years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The South Carolina lands and modes of culture are not
well adapted to corn. A rotation of crops is deemed necessary
to keep the soil in a condition to raise it successfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>The decay of cotton seed and waste cotton is its best fertilizer.
During the war, when little cotton was raised, planters became
alarmed at the yearly decrease of the corn crop. The average
yield, throughout the State, the first year, was fifteen bushels
to the acre; the second, twelve bushels; the third, nine bushels;
and the fourth, six bushels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the war, the city of Charleston exported annually
one hundred and twenty-five thousand tierces of rice. This
year, it is <em>importing</em> rice of an inferior quality from the West
Indies. This fact indicates the condition of that culture. Yet
in the face of it, rice-planters were raising the price of their
lands from fifty dollars an acre, for which they could be bought
before the war, to one hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the rice plantations are confined to the tide-water region,
where the fields can be flooded after sowing, their present
prospects were more or less embarrassed by the knotty Sea-Island
question. “If our people this year make one sixth of
an average rice-crop,” said Governor Orr, “they will be fortunate,
and they will be doing well. In old times, our annual
crop brought upwards of three and a half million dollars,
when rice was only five cents a pound.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroads of South Carolina were nearly worn out
during the war. All sorts of iron were used to keep them in
repair; and the old rolling-stock was kept running until it
was ready to fall to pieces. Then Sherman came. The
South Carolina Road, wealthy before the war, was relaying
its torn-up track and rebuilding its extensive trestle-work and
bridges, as fast as its earnings would permit. The branch to
Columbia was once more in operation; but, on the main road
to Augusta, travel was eked out by a night of terribly rough
staging.</p>

<p class='c000'>The finances of South Carolina were at a low ebb. Governor
Orr told me that there had not been a dollar in the
State treasury since his inauguration. The current expenses
of the war were mostly met by taxation; and the annual interest
on the foreign debt of two and a half millions had been
promptly paid, up to July, 1865, by the exportation of cotton.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>The State bank was obliged to suspend its operations, but the
faith of the State was pledged for the redemption of the bills.
The other banks had been ruined by loans made to the Confederate
government. Their stock had been considered the
safest in the market, and the property of widows and orphans
was largely invested in it. The estates of the stockholders,
liable for double the amount of the bills issued, were insufficient
to redeem them. In January, 1866, two National
Banks had been organized in the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aggregate of debts, old and new, in South Carolina,
were estimated to be worth not more than twenty-five per
cent. of their par value.</p>

<p class='c000'>South Carolina had suffered more than any other State by
the Sale of lands for United States taxes, during the war. I
heard of one estate, worth fifteen thousand dollars, which had
been sold for three hundred dollars. Governor Orr instanced
another, the market value of which was twenty-four thousand
dollars, which was bought in by the government for eighty
dollars. Such was the fate of abandoned coast lands held by
the United States forces. Their owners, absent in the interior,
were in most instances ignorant even of the proceedings
by which their estates were sacrificed. In this way, according
to the governor, “the entire parish of St. Helena, and a
portion of St. Luke’s, have completely changed hands, and
passed either into the possession of the government, or of
third parties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The prevalence of crime in remote districts was alarming.
I was assured by General Sickles that the perpetrators were in
most cases outlaws from other States, to which they dared not
return. Union soldiers and negroes were their favorite victims.
They rode in armed bands through the country, defying
the military authorities. The people would not inform against
them for fear of their vengeance. Many robberies and murders
of soldiers and freedmen, however, were unmistakably
committed by citizens.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much ill-feeling had been kept alive by United States treasury
agents, searching the country for Confederate cotton and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>branded mules and horses. Many of these agents, as far as I
could learn, both in this and in other States, were mere rogues
and fortune-hunters. They would propose to seize a man’s
property in the name of the United States, but abandon the
claim on the payment of heavy bribes, which of course went
into their own pockets. Sometimes, having seized “C. S. A.”
cotton, they would have the marks on the bales changed, get
some man to claim it, and divide with him the profits. Such
practices had a pernicious effect, engendering a contempt for
the government, and a murderous ill-will which too commonly
vented itself upon soldiers and negroes.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found in South Carolina a more virulent animosity existing
in the minds of the common people, against the government
and people of the North, than in any other State I visited.
Only in South Carolina was I treated with gross personal insults
on account of my Northern origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is notwithstanding in this State a class of men whom
I remember with admiration for their courteous hospitality and
liberal views. Instead of insulting and repelling Northern
men, they invite them, and seem eager to learn of them the
secret of Northern enterprise and prosperity. Their ideas,
although not those of New-England radicals, are hopeful and
progressive. Considering that they have advanced from the
Southern side of the national question, their position is notable
and praiseworthy. This class is small, but it possesses a vital
energy of which great results may be predicted. From it the
freedmen have much to hope and little to fear. It is not so
far in advance of the people that it cannot lead them; nor so
far behind the most advanced sentiment of the times that we
may not expect them soon to come up to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Foremost among this class is Governor Orr,—almost the
only man in South Carolina who seemed to me prepared to
consider dispassionately the subject of universal suffrage. The
color of the negro’s skin, he said, was no good reason for keeping
the ballot out of his hand. “In this country, suffrage is
progressive; and when the colored people are prepared for it,
they will have it.” A large proportion of the freedmen, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>felt sure, would become industrious and respectable citizens.
As an instance of the capacity and fidelity shown by many of
their race, he gave an account of one of his own slaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is by trade a carpenter, and a first-class workman.
He was the son of his original owner, who emancipated him
by his will, and gave him, with his liberty, a mule, a saddle, a
set of tools, and some money. One of the heirs of the estate
was the executor of the will. Finding Henry a very valuable
man, he looked for some legal flaw by which the will could be
broken. There was a law of South Carolina designed to prevent
slave-owners from emancipating old worn-out servants,
and thus converting them into public paupers. It required
the master, before freeing his servant, to make a certain statement,
under oath, that the said servant was capable of self-support.
This formality had been neglected in Henry’s case;
and the court decided that he must remain a slave. When
the fact was made known to him, he said to the executor, ‘If
the court has so decided, I suppose I must abide by the decision.
It is unjust, but I submit to it. But I will never serve
you. I have lost all confidence in you, and all respect for you;
and the best thing you can do is to sell me.’ The executor
was so impressed by this declaration, that he told him to go
and choose his future master. He came to me, and entreated
me to buy him. I finally consented to do so, and paid his
price,—fifteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He lived as my slave until the close of the war; and all
the time his patience under his great wrong was wonderful.
He never complained; and he served me with the most
conscientious fidelity. By overwork, he earned two hundred
dollars a year, which he spent upon his family. I had bought
him a set of tools worth five hundred dollars, and scientific
books worth one hundred, which I gave him when we parted.
He has wit and education enough to understand the books, I
assure you. He is now doing business in Columbia. He
might become wealthy, but he is too generous. He will not
spend his earnings foolishly, but he will share whatever he
has with his people. If I was in want, he would give me his
last dollar.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>There were in January fifty freedmen’s schools in operation
in South Carolina, with one hundred and twenty teachers, and
ten thousand pupils. The New-England Freedmen’s Aid, and
the National Freedmen’s Association, had each about fifty
teachers in the field. The Boston teachers in Charleston get
forty-five dollars a month, and pay their own expenses. At
other points, where expenses are less, they get thirty-five dollars.
The average yearly cost of each teacher to the associations
is six hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The American Missionary Association, the Pennsylvania
Freedmen’s Relief, and the Friends’ Freedmen’s Association,
had also teachers in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>The State superintendent of freedmen’s schools spoke in high
praise of the school in the Normal school building, at Charleston.
The principal was a colored man who had been educated
at his own expense at the University of Glasgow. Another
teacher was a colored girl, who had taught a free colored school
in Charleston during the war,—paying half her income to a
white woman for sitting and sewing in the school-room, and
appearing as the teacher, when it was visited by the police.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This woman’s pupils,” said Mr. Tomlinson, “draw maps,
and do everything white girls of twelve and sixteen years do,
in ordinary advanced schools.” General Richardson of the
Eastern District, had set a number of old soldiers, unfit for
military duty, to teaching the freedmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not much active opposition shown to the schools
in the State, nor yet much encouragement. Only here and
there an enlightened planter saw the necessity of education for
the negroes, and favored it.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE RIDE TO WINNSBORO’.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For a distance of thirty miles north of Columbia, I had an
interesting experience of staging over that portion of the Charlotte
and South Carolina Railroad destroyed by Sherman.
Much of the way the stage route ran beside or near the track.
Gangs of laborers were engaged in putting down new ties and
rails, but most of the old iron lay where our boys left it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the Seventeenth Corps that did this little job, and it
did it well. It was curious to note the different styles of the
destroying parties. The point where one detail appeared to
have left off and another to have begun was generally unmistakable.
For a mile or two you would see nothing but hair-pins,
and bars wound around telegraph posts and trees. Then
you would have corkscrews and twists for about the same distance.
Then came a party that gave each heated rail one
sharp wrench in the middle, and left it perhaps nearly straight,
but facing both ways. Here was a plain business method, and
there a fantastic style, which showed that its authors took a
wild delight in their work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning I rode with the driver, in the hope of
learning something of him with regard to the country. But
he proved to be a refugee from East Tennessee, where he said
a rope-noose was waiting for him. An active Rebel, he had
been guilty of some offences which the Union men there could
not forgive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding him as ignorant of the country as myself, I got
down, and took a seat inside the coach. Within, an animated
political discussion was at its height. Two South Carolinians
and a planter from Arkansas were dissecting the Yankees in
liveliest fashion; while a bitter South Carolina lady and a
good-natured Virginian occasionally put in a word.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>It was some time before I was recognized as a representative
of all that was mean and criminal in the world. At length
something I said seemed to excite suspicion; and the Arkansan
wrote something on a card, which was passed to every
one of the company except me. An alarming hush of several
minutes ensued. It was as if a skeleton had appeared at a banquet.
The abuse of the Yankees was the banquet; and I was
perfectly well aware that I was the skeleton. At last the
awful silence was broken by the Arkansan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is thought of negro suffrage at the North?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The question was addressed to me. I replied that opinion
was divided on that subject; but that many people believed
some such security was necessary for the freedmen’s rights.
“They do not think it quite safe,” I said, “to leave him without
any voice in making the laws by which he is to be governed,—subject
entirely to the legislation of a class that cannot
forget that he was born a slave.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe,” said one of the South Carolinians, “all that is
owing to the lies of the newspaper correspondents travelling
through the South, and writing home whatever they think
will injure us. I wish every one of ’em was killed off. If it
wasn’t for them, we should be left to attend to our own business,
instead of being ridden to death by our Yankee masters.
It isn’t fair to take solitary instances reported by them, as
representing the condition of the niggers and the disposition
of the whites. Some impudent darkey, who deserves it, gets
a knock on the head, or a white man speaks his mind rather
too freely to some Yankee who has purposely provoked him,
and a long newspaper story is made out of it, showing that
every nigger in the South is in danger of being killed, and
every white man is disloyal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly,” I said, “isolated cases do not represent a
whole people. But the acts of a legislative body may be
supposed to represent the spirit and wishes of its constituents.
We consider the negro code enacted by your special legislature
simply abominable. It is enough of itself to show that
you are not quite ready to do the freedmen justice. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>present governor appears to be of the same opinion, judged
by his veto of the act to amend the patrol laws, and his excellent
advice to your representatives who passed it. You are
wholly mistaken, my friend, in supposing that the people of
the North wish anything of you that is unnecessary, unreasonable,
or unjust. They may be mistaken with regard to what
is necessary, but they are honest in their intentions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All we want,” said the South Carolinian, “is that our
Yankee rulers should give us the same privileges with regard
to the control of labor which they themselves have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well; what privileges have they which you have
not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In Massachusetts, a laborer is obliged by law to make a
contract for a year. If he leaves his employer without his
consent, or before the term of his contract expires, he can be
put in jail. And if another man hires him, he can be fined.
It is not lawful there to hire a laborer who does not bring a
certificate from his last employer. All we want is the same
or a similar code of laws here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear sir,” said I, “all any man could wish is that you
might have just such laws here as they have in Massachusetts.
But with regard to the code you speak of, it does not
exist there, and it does not exist in any Northern State with
which I am acquainted. There is nothing like it anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you manage without such laws? How can you
get work out of a man unless you <em>compel</em> him in some way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Natural laws compel him; we need no others. A man
must work if he would eat. A faithful laborer is soon discovered,
and he commands the best wages. An idle fellow is
detected quite as soon; and if he will not do the work he has
agreed to do, he is discharged. Thus the system regulates
itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t do that way with niggers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you ever tried? Have you ever called your freedmen
together and explained to them their new condition? A
planter I saw in Alabama told me how he managed this thing.
He said to his people, ‘If you do well, I shall want you another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>year. The man who does best will be worth the most
to me. But if you are lazy and unfaithful, I shall dismiss you
when your contracts are ended, and hire better men. Do you
know why some overseers are always wandering about in
search of a situation?’ ‘Because nobody wants ’em,’ said
the negroes. ‘Why not?’ ‘Because they a’n’t good for
their business.’ ‘Why did I keep John Bird only one year?’
‘Because, soon as your back was turned, he slipped off to a
grocery, or went a-fishing.’ ‘And why did I keep William
Hooker eight years, and increase his salary every year?’
‘Because he stuck by and always looked after your interest.’
‘Now,’ said the planter, ‘you are in the condition of these
overseers. You can always have good situations, and your
prospects will be continually improving, if you do well. Or
you may soon be going about the country with bundles on
your backs, miserable low-down niggers that nobody will hire.’
In this way he instructed and encouraged the freedmen; and
he assured me they were working better than ever. But by
your serf-codes you would crush all hope and manhood out of
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, there may be something in all that. I can’t say,
for I never thought of trying but one way with a nigger. But
nigger suffrage the South a’n’t going to stand anyhow. We’ve
already got a class of voters that’s enough to corrupt the politics
of any country. I used to think the nigger was the
meanest of God’s creatures. But I’ve found a meaner brute
than he; and that’s the low-down white man. If a respectable
man hires a nigger for wages, one of those low-down
cusses will offer him twice as much, to get him away. They
want him to prowl for them. A heap of these no-account
whites are getting rich, stealing cotton; they’re too lazy or
cowardly to do it themselves, so they get the niggers to do it
for ’em. These very men hold the balance of political power
in this district. They’ll vote for the man who gives ’em the
most whiskey. Just before the war, at an election in Columbia,
over a hundred sand-hillers sold their votes beforehand,
and were put into jail till the polls opened, and then marched
out to vote.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>“By what right were they put in jail?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was in the bargain. They knew they couldn’t be
trusted not to sell their votes to the next man that offered
more whiskey, and they like going to jail well enough, if they
can go drunk. Make the niggers voters, and you’ll have just
such another class to be bought up with whiskey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me more reasonable,” I replied, “to suppose
that the franchise will elevate the negro; and by elevating
him you will elevate the white man who has been degraded
by the negro’s degradation. Some of both races will no doubt
be found willing to sell their votes, as well as their souls, for
whiskey; but that is no more a reason why all blacks should
be deprived of the right of suffrage, than that all whites
should be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a specimen of the talk that was kept up during the
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>We stopped to dine at a house, where I was told by a young
lady that the Yankees were the greatest set of rogues, and
that some passed there every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it possible!” I said. “Are you not afraid of them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have nothing whatever to do with them. I should be
ashamed to be seen talking with one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then be careful that no one sees you now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>You</em> are not a Yankee!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said I, “I am one of that set of rogues.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am very sorry to hear it, for I had formed a more favorable
opinion of you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the good-natured Virginian went in with me to the
dining-room. The lady of the house, sitting at the table with
us, soon began to talk about the Yankees. “They often dine
here,” she said. “But I have nothing to say to them. As
soon as I know who they are, I go out of the room.” She
was very sociable; and when I informed her at parting that
she had been entertaining a Yankee, she appeared confused
and incredulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the spirit commonly shown by the middle class of
South Carolinians. But I remember some marked exceptions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>Late in the afternoon we stopped at a place which a sturdy old
farmer said was Ridgeway before Sherman came there: “I
don’t know what you’d call it now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the devil don’t get old Sherman,” said one of my travelling
companions, “there a’n’t no use having a devil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We did it ourselves,” said the farmer. “We druv the
nail and the Yankees clinched it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the coach, the South Carolinians had just been denying
that any outrages were committed on the freedmen in that
part of the country. So I asked this man if he had heard of
any such.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heard of ’em? I hear of ’em every day. I’m going to
Columbia to-night to attend the trial of one of my neighbors
for shooting a negro woman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must expect such things to happen when the niggers
are impudent,” observed one of my companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The niggers a’n’t to blame,” said the farmer. “They’re
never impudent, unless they’re trifled with or imposed on.
Only two days ago a nigger was walking along this road, as
peaceably as any man you ever saw. He met a white man
right here, who asked him who he belonged to. ‘I don’t
belong to anybody now,’ he says; ‘I’m a free man.’ ‘Sass
me? you black devil!’ says the white fellow; and he pitched
into him, and cut him in four or five places with his knife. I
heard and saw the whole of it, and I say the nigger was respectful,
and that the white fellow was the only one to blame.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What became of the negro?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know; he went off to some of his people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what was done with the white man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing. There’s nobody to do anything in such cases,
unless the nigger goes all the way to the Freedmen’s Bureau
and makes a complaint. Then there’s little chance of getting
the fellow that cut him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Three miles further on, we reached a point to which the
railroad had been repaired, and took the cars for Winnsboro’.
While we were waiting by moonlight in the shelterless and
stumpy camping-ground which served as a station, one of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>South Carolina friends said to me: “We may as well tell the
whole truth as half. The Yankees treated us mighty badly:
but a heap of our own people followed in their track and robbed
on their credit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the train I found a hotel-keeper from Winnsboro’ drumming
for customers. He was abusing the Yankees with great
violence and passion until he found that I was one. After that
he kept remarkably quiet, and even apologized to me for his
remarks, until I told him I had concluded to go to the house
of a rival runner. Thereupon he broke forth again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ve left me one inestimable privilege—to hate ’em.
I git up at half-past four in the morning, and sit up till twelve
at night, to hate ’em. Talk about Union! They had no object
in coming down here, but just to steal. I’m like a whipped
cur; I have to cave in; but that don’t say I shall love ’em.
I owned my own house, my own servants, my own garden, and
in one night they reduced me to poverty. My house was near
the State House in Columbia. It was occupied by Howard’s
head-quarters. When they left, they just poured camphene
over the beds, set ’em afire, locked up the house, and threw
away the key. That was after the burning of the town, and
that’s what made it so hard. Some one had told ’em I was
one of the worst Rebels in the world, and that’s the only truth
I reckon, that was told. I brought up seven boys, and what
they hadn’t killed was fighting against ’em then. Now I
have to keep a boarding-house in Winnsboro’ to support my
wife and children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At Winnsboro’ I passed the night. A portion of that town
also had been destroyed; and there too Sherman’s “bummers”
were said to have behaved very naughtily. For instance:
“When the Episcopal church was burning, they took
out the melodeon, and played the devil’s tunes on it till the
house was well burned down: then they threw on the melodeon.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXX.<br /> <span class='large'>A GLIMPSE OF THE OLD NORTH STATE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The next day I entered North Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost immediately on crossing the State line, a change of
scene was perceptible. The natural features of the country
improved; the appearance of its farms improved still more.
North Carolina farmers use manures, and work with their own
hands. They treat the soil more generously than their South
Carolina neighbors, and it repays them.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night I passed at the house of a Connecticut man, in
a country village,—a warm and comfortable New-England
home transported to a southern community,—and went on
the next day to Raleigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Raleigh I found the Legislature,—composed mostly of
a respectable and worthy-looking yeomanry—battling over
the question of negro testimony in the civil courts; spending
day after day in the discussion of a subject which could be
settled in only one way, and which ought to have been settled
at once. One member remarked outside: “I’ll never vote
for that bill unless driven to it by the bayonet.” Another
said: “I’m opposed to giving niggers <em>any</em> privileges.” These
men represent a large class of North Carolina farmers; but
fortunately there is another class of more progressive and liberal
ideas, which are sure at last to prevail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The business of Raleigh was dull, the money in the country
being exhausted. A few Northern men, who had gone into
trade there, were discouraged, and anxious to get away.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>
<img src='images/i_579.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>“So great is the impoverishment of our State,” Governor
Worth said to me, “that a tax of any considerable amount
would bring real estate at once into the market.” Among
other causes, the repudiation of the entire State debt contracted
during the war, had contributed to destroy the resources
of the people. The middling and poorer classes had
invested nearly all their surplus means in State treasury notes,
which became worthless. The cause of education suffered
with everything else. The University of North Carolina had
all its funds invested in the banks; “Repudiation killed the
banks,” said Governor Worth, “and the banks killed the University.”
A million dollars of the common-school fund went
the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>North Carolina, like several of her Southern sisters, had
passed a stay law, which threatened a serious injury to her
interests. By preventing the collection of debts, it destroyed
credit, of which the people, in their present condition, stand
so much in need. Although unconstitutional and impolitic, so
great was the popularity of this law, that the ablest politicians
feared to make an effort for its repeal.</p>

<p class='c000'>By one of its provisions, a mortgage inures to the benefit of
all the creditors of the mortgagor. Many large estates were,
necessarily, to be broken up; and the best thing that could
happen, for them and for the community, was, that they should
fall into the hands of small farmers; but, in consequence of
this curious law, the owners would not sell to these men, except
for cash, which was lacking.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Southern stay laws, I may here mention, do not
touch the rights of a Northern creditor, who can bring his suit
in United States courts, which ignore them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Northern men in the State were mostly settled on cotton
plantations in the eastern counties. There were also many
engaged in the turpentine and lumber business in the southern
part, and along the coast. In the central and western
parts there were almost none.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the extensive rice plantations of the tide-water region,
but few were in operation, owing to the great outlay of capital
necessary to carry them on. To seed them alone involves an
expense of ten dollars an acre. Yet, from the representations
of Northern men who had gone to rice planting, I am satisfied
that here is an opening for very profitable investments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>The small farmers of North Carolina are a plain, old-fashioned,
upright, ignorant class of men. Mr. Best, Secretary of
State, told me that forty-five per cent. of those who took the
oath of allegiance in Green County, where he administered it,
made their marks. “Yet many of these are men of as strong
sense as any in the State,” he added; “and they were generally
Union men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The freedmen throughout the central and northern part of
the State, had very generally made contracts, and were at
work. In the southern part, fewer contracts had been made,
in consequence of the inability of the large planters to pay
promptly. “When paid promptly, the freedmen are everywhere
working well,” I was assured by the officers of the
Bureau. The rate of wages varied from five to ten dollars
a month.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were in the State one hundred teachers, supplied by
the benevolent societies of the North. Their schools, scattered
throughout the State, were attended by eight thousand
five hundred colored pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cases of robberies, frauds, assaults, and even murders, in
which white persons were the agents and freed people the
sufferers, had been so numerous, according to the State Commissioner,
“that no record of them could be kept; one officer
reporting that he had heard and disposed of as many as a
hundred and eighty complaints in one day.” Owing to the
efforts of the Bureau, however, the number was fast decreasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Governor Worth, I received a rather sorry account
of the doings of Sherman’s “bummers” in this State. Even
after the pacification they continued their lawless marauding.
“They visited my place, near Raleigh, and drove off a fine
flock of ewes and lambs. I was State Treasurer at the time,
and having to go away on public business, I gave my negroes
their bacon, which they hid behind the ceiling of the house.
The Yankees came, and held an axe over the head of one of
the negroes, and by threats compelled him to tell where it
was. They tore off the ceiling, and stole all the bacon. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>took all my cows. Three cows afterwards came back; but they
recently disappeared again, and I found them in the possession
of a man who says he bought them of these bummers. I had
a grindstone, and as they couldn’t carry it off, they smashed
it. There was on my place a poor, old, blind negro woman,—the
last creature in the world against whom I should suppose
any person would have wished to commit a wrong. She
had a new dress; and they stole even that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was known as a peace man,” said the Governor, “and for
that reason I did not suffer as heavily as my neighbors.” He
gave this testimony with regard to that class which served,
but did not honor, our cause: “Of all the malignant wretches
that ever cursed the earth, the hangers-on of Sherman’s army
were the worst;” adding: “It can’t be expected that the
people should love a government that has subjugated them in
this way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>CONCLUSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I made but a brief stay in North Carolina, but passed on
homeward, and reached the beautiful snowy hills and frosted
forests of New England early in February.</p>

<p class='c000'>It now only remains for me to sum up briefly my answers
to certain questions which are constantly put to me, regarding
Southern emigration, the loyalty of the people, and the future
of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The South is in the condition of a man recovering from a
dangerous malady: the crisis is past, appetite is boundless, and
only sustenance and purifying air are needed to bring health
and life in fresh waves. The exhausted country calls for supplies.
It has been drained of its wealth, and of its young men.
Capital is eagerly welcomed and absorbed. Labor is also
needed. There is much shallow talk about getting rid of the
negroes, and of filling their places with foreigners. But war
and disease have already removed more of the colored race
than can be well spared; and I am confident that, for the next
five or ten years, leaving the blacks where they are, the strongest
tide of emigration that can be poured into the country will
be insufficient to meet the increasing demand for labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Northern enterprise, emancipation, improved modes of culture,
and the high prices of cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco,
cannot fail to bring about this result. The cotton crop, if no
accident happens to it, will this year reach, I am well satisfied,
not less than two million bales, and bring something like two
hundred and fifty million dollars,—as much as the five million
bales of 1859 produced. Next year it will approximate to its
old average standard in bulk, and greatly exceed it in value;
and the year after we shall have the largest cotton crop ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>known. Meanwhile the culture of rice and sugar will have
fully revived, and become enormously profitable. Nor will
planting alone flourish. Burned cities and plantation-buildings
must be restored, new towns and villages will spring up, old
losses must be repaired, and a thousand new wants supplied.
Trade, manufactures, the mechanic arts, all are invited to share
in this teeming activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Particular location the emigrant must select for himself,
according to his own judgment, tastes, and means. Just now
I should not advise Northern men to settle far back from the
main routes of travel, unless they go in communities, purchasing
and dividing large plantations, and forming societies independent
of any hostile sentiment that may be shown by the
native inhabitants. But I trust that in a year or two all danger
of discomfort or disturbance arising from this source will
have mostly passed by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loyalty of the people is generally of a negative sort:
it is simply disloyalty subdued. They submit to the power
which has mastered them, but they do not love it; nor is it
reasonable to expect that they should. Many of them lately
in rebellion, are, I think, honestly convinced that secession was
a great mistake, and that the preservation of the Union, even
with the loss of slavery, is better for them than any such separate
government as that of which they had a bitter taste. Yet
they do not feel much affection for the hand which corrected
their error. They acquiesce quietly in what cannot be helped,
and sincerely desire to make the best of their altered circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another class which would still be glad to dismember
the country, and whose hatred of the government is radical
and intense. But this class is small.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor whites may be divided into three classes: those
who, to their hatred of the negro, join a hatred of the government
that has set him free; those who associate with the negro,
and care nothing for any government; and those who, cherishing
more or less Union sentiment, rejoice to see the old aristocracy
overthrown.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>Except in certain localities, like East Tennessee, positive
unconditional Union men are an exceedingly small minority.
But they are a leaven which, properly encouraged, should
leaven the whole lump of Southern society. Upon the close
of hostilities, these men who, for near five years suffered unrelenting
persecution, rose temporarily to a position of influence
which their conduct had earned. Secession saw with dismay
that to this class the first place in the future government of the
country rightfully belonged. Their old neighbors, who had
so long done evil to them continually, or given them only dark
looks, now shrank sullenly out of their sight, or openly courted
their smiles. A professed Union sentiment blossomed everywhere;
lives, that had all along been thistles, now bore a
plentiful harvest of figs. This was a hopeful state of things.
It is better, as an example to a community, that goodness
should receive insincere homage, than none at all; and that
men should assume a virtue if they have it not. But as soon
as it was seen that the muttering thunder-cloud of retribution
was passing by with nothing but sound, and that loyal men
were not to have the first, nor even the second or third or
fourth place, in the government of the lately rebellious States,
they sank to their former position. What is needed now is to
cause this class, and the principles they represent, to be permanently
respected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mere utterance of disloyal sentiments need not alarm
any one. It is often sincere; but it is sometimes mere cant,
easily kept in vogue, by newspapers and politicians, among a
people who delight in vehement and minatory talk, for the
mere talk’s sake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of another armed rebellion not the least apprehension need
be entertained. The South has had enough of war for a long
time to come; it has supped full of horrors. The habiliments
of mourning, which one sees everywhere in its towns and
cities, will cast their dark shadow upon any future attempt at
secession, long after they have been put away in the silent
wardrobes of the past. Only in the case of a foreign war
might we expect to see a party of malignant malcontents go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>over to the side of the enemy. They would doubtless endeavor
to drag their States with them, but they would not succeed.
Fortunately those who are still so anxious to see the old issue
fought out, are not themselves fighting men, and are dangerous
only with their tongues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of <em>unarmed</em> rebellion, of continued sectional strife, stirred
up by Southern politicians, there exists very great danger.
Their aims are distinct, and they command the sympathy of
the Southern people. To obtain the exclusive control of the
freedmen, and to make such laws for them as shall embody the
prejudices of a late slave-holding society; to govern not only
their own States, but to regain their forfeited leadership in the
affairs of the nation; to effect the repudiation of the national
debt, or to get the Confederate debt and the Rebel State debts
assumed by the whole country; to secure payment for their
slaves, and for all injuries and losses occasioned by the war;
these are among the chief designs of a class who will pursue
them with what recklessness and persistency we know.</p>

<p class='c000'>How to prevent them from agitating the nation in the future
as in the past, and from destroying its prosperity, is become
the most serious of questions. If you succeed in capturing an
antagonist who has made a murderous assault upon you, common
sense, and a regard for your own safety and the peace of
society, require at least that his weapons, or the power of using
them, should be taken from him. These perilous schemes
are the present weapons of the nation’s conquered enemy; and
does not prudent statesmanship demand that they should be
laid forever at rest before he walks again at large in the pride
of his power?</p>

<p class='c000'>All that just and good men can ask, is this security. Vindictiveness,
or a wish to hold the rebellious States under an
iron rule, should have no place in our hearts. But if the blood
of our brothers was shed in a righteous cause,—if for four
years we poured out lives and treasures to purchase a reality,
and no mere mockery and shadow,—let us honor our brothers
and the cause by seeing that reality established. If treason
is a crime surely it can receive no more fitting or merciful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>punishment than to be deprived of its power to do more mischief.
Let peace, founded upon true principles, be the only
retribution we demand. Let justice be our vengeance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was my original intention to speak of the various schemes
of reconstruction claiming the consideration of the country.
But they have become too numerous, and are generally too
well known, to be detailed here. The Southern plan is simple;
it is this: that the States, lately so eager to destroy the
Union, are now entitled to all their former rights and privileges
in that Union. Their haste to withdraw their representatives
from Congress, is more than equalled by their anxiety
to get them back in their seats. They consider it hard that,
at the end of the most stupendous rebellion and the bloodiest
civil war that ever shook the planet, they cannot quietly slip
back in their places, and, the sword having failed, take up
once more the sceptre of political power they so rashly flung
down. Often, in conversation with candid Southern men,
impatient for this result, I was able to convince them that it
was hardly to be expected, that the government, emerging
victorious from the dust of such a struggle, and finding its
foot on that sceptre, should take it off with very great alacrity.
And they were forced to acknowledge that, had the South
proved victorious, its enemies would not have escaped so
easily.</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan does not tolerate the impediment of any Congressional
test oath. When I said to my Southern friends
that I should be glad to see those representatives, who could
take the test oath, admitted to Congress, this was the usual
reply:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“We would not vote for such men. We had rather have
no representatives at all. We want representatives to <em>represent</em>
us, and no man <em>represents</em> us who can take your test oath.
We are Rebels, if you choose to call us so, and only a good
Rebel can properly represent us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the strongest argument I have heard against the
admission of loyal Southern members to Congress. And if
the white masses of the lately rebellious States are alone, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>indiscriminately, to be recognized as the people of those States,
it is certainly a valid argument.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is enough,” they maintained, “that a representative in
Congress takes the ordinary oath to support the government;
<em>that</em> is a sufficient test of his loyalty;”—forgetting that, at
the outbreak of the rebellion, this proved no test at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such is the Southern plan of reconstruction. Opposed to
it is the plan on which I believe a majority of the people of
the loyal States are agreed, namely, that certain guaranties
of future national tranquillity should be required of those who
have caused so great a national convulsion. But as to what
those guaranties should be, opinions are divided, and a hundred
conflicting measures are proposed for the settlement of
the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>For my own part, I see but one plain rule by which our
troubles can be finally and satisfactorily adjusted; and that is,
the enactment of simple justice for all men. Anything that
falls short of this falls short of the solution of the problem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Civil Rights Bill,”—enacted since the greater portion
of these pages were written,—is a step in the direction
in which this country is inevitably moving. The principles of
the Declaration of Independence, supposed to be our starting-point
in history, are in reality the goal towards which we
are tending. Far in advance of our actual civilization, the
pioneers of the Republic set up those shining pillars. Not
until all men are equal before the law, and none is hindered
from rising or from sinking by any impediment which does
not exist in his own constitution and private circumstances,
will that goal be reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon or late the next step is surely coming. That step
is universal suffrage. It may be wise to make some moral or
intellectual qualification a test of a man’s fitness for the franchise;
but anything which does not apply alike to all classes,
and which all are not invited to attain, is inconsistent with the
spirit of American nationality.</p>

<p class='c000'>But will the Southern people ever submit to negro suffrage?
They will submit to it quite as willingly as they submitted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>negro emancipation. They fought against that as long as any
power of resistance was in them; then they accepted it; they
are now becoming reconciled to it; and soon they will rejoice
over it. Such is always the history of progressive ideas. The
first advance is opposed with all the might of the world until
its triumph is achieved; then the world says, “Very well,”
and employs all its arts and energies to defeat the next movement,
which triumphs and is finally welcomed in its turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of the war, the South was ready to accept any
terms which the victorious government might have seen fit to
enforce. The ground was thoroughly broken; it was fresh
from the harrow; and then was the time for the sowing of
the new seed, before delay had given encouragement and
opportunity to the old rank weeds. The States had practically
dissolved their relations to the general government. Their
chief men were traitors, their governors and legislators were
entitled to no recognition, and a new class of free citizens,
composing near half the population, had been created. If, in
these changed circumstances, all the people of those States had
been called upon to unite in restoring their respective governments,
and their relations to the general government, we
should have had a simple and easy solution of the main question
at issue. Our allies on the battle-field would have become
our allies at the ballot-box, and by doing justice to them we
should have gained security for ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>But are the lately emancipated blacks prepared for the
franchise? They are, by all moral and intellectual qualifications,
as well prepared for it as the mass of poor whites in the
South. Although ignorant, they possess, as has been said, a
strong instinct which stands them in the place of actual
knowledge. That instinct inspires them with loyalty to the
government, and it will never permit them to vote so unwisely
and mischievously as the white people of the South voted in
the days of secession. Moreover, there are among them men
of fine intelligence and leading influence, by whom, and not
by their old masters, as has been claimed, they will be instructed
in their duty at the polls. And this fact is most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>certain,—that they are far better prepared to have a hand
in making the laws by which they are to be governed, than
the whites are to make those laws for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>How this step is now to be brought about, is not easy to
determine; and it may not be brought about for some time
to come. In the mean while it is neither wise nor just to
allow the representation of the Southern States in Congress
to be increased by the emancipation of a race that has no
voice in that representation; and some constitutional remedy
against this evil is required. And in the mean while the protection
of the government must be continued to the race to
which its faith is pledged. Let us hope not long.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present high price of cotton, and the extraordinary
demand for labor, seem providential circumstances, designed
to teach both races a great lesson. The freedmen are fast
learning the responsibilities of their new situation, and gaining
a position from which they cannot easily be displaced. Their
eagerness to acquire knowledge is a bright sign of hope for
their future. By degrees the dominant class must learn to
respect those who, as chattels, could only be despised. Respect
for labor rises with the condition of the laborer. The
whites of the South are not by choice ignorant or unjust, but
circumstances have made them so. Teach them that the
laborer is a man, and that labor is manly,—a truth that is
now dawning upon them,—and the necessity of mediation
between the two races will no longer exist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the institutions of the South will spontaneously assimilate
to our own. Then we shall have a Union of States, not
in form only, but in spirit also. Then shall we see established
the reality of the cause that has cost so many priceless lives
and such lavish outpouring of treasure. Then will disloyalty
die of inanition, and its deeds live only in legend and in story.
Then breaks upon America the morning glory of that future
which shall behold it the Home of Man, and the Lawgiver
among the nations.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hopes expressed by the writer in the preceding
chapter were not destined to realize a speedy fruition. The
uncertainties arising from the somewhat sudden change in
President Johnson’s policy, and the hesitancy manifested by
Congress in the adoption of a fixed policy of reconstruction,
were already, when that chapter was written, beginning to
bear their legitimate fruit. The Southern whites who had
participated actively or passively in the Rebellion, and who,
when the war closed, were ready to submit without murmuring
to such terms as the conquering party saw fit to prescribe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>had already begun to put on the airs of equals or superiors,
and to dictate the terms on which they would come back into
the Union. They scouted the idea that negroes had any
rights which whites were bound to respect, or that they themselves
had by their rebellion forfeited any rights or powers
which they had formerly enjoyed. In short, they insisted
upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo ante bellum</span></i> as their rightful position.
While maintaining that it was their right and privilege to
honor the graves and memories of the rebel leaders and soldiers
who had fallen during the war, and to glorify the living
generals and other officers, who had fought for what they
fondly called the Lost Cause, they were intolerant of any
honors being paid to the Union dead in the South, or any
mention of living Union generals, unless accompanied with
some scurrilous epithet. A Southern man or woman who
had been loyal to the Union during the war, was an object of
bitterest hate. If colored, he was shot down, hung, or beaten
to death at the first opportunity, and there were always
enough “lewd fellows of the baser sort,” ready for this work.
If a white man, his cattle were killed, his horses stolen, his
poultry carried off, his barns were burned, and jokes, about
their being struck by lightning on a clear night, were whispered;
his crops were destroyed, and he was warned to leave
the neighborhood. These were common occurrences in the
country. In the towns, it was not quite so bad, except when
the mob element was roused to activity, because the number
of loyal Union men there was larger, and they were able to
protect each other, to some extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some sections this bitterness toward Union men was
much more intense than in others. In the interior of Louisiana,
in Texas, in Southern Alabama, in considerable sections
of Mississippi, in Southern Georgia, and along the coast in
the vicinity of Charleston, S. C., and in the neighborhood of
Richmond, Petersburg, and Norfolk, Virginia, it was specially
rife. West Tennessee too had its full share of it, and Kentucky
was the most rebellious State in or out of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>It should be remarked, too, that this bitterness did not pervade
all classes, even among those who had formerly participated
in the Rebellion. The men who had fought most
bravely for the South were, very generally, disposed to accept
reasonable terms from the victors. They had fought well, but
they had been whipped, and there was nothing left but submission,
and the endeavor to restore to the South its lost
prosperity. In this view of the case, Lieutenant-Generals
Longstreet and Johnston, and Major-Generals Forrest, Jeff.
Thompson, and many others, coincided; and they, as well as
some thousands of the former rebel soldiers, went to work
manfully to aid in reconstruction on a fair and liberal basis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most noisy and violent of the supporters of the “Lost
Cause,” as they styled themselves, were men and women who
had taken no active part, except with their tongues, in the Rebellion,
often of Northern birth, but thoroughly southernized
in feeling; or, if the men had been connected with the Southern
army or navy, they had been depredators on unarmed
merchant ships, like Raphael Semmes, J. N. Maffit, or Lieutenant
Braine; or bushwhackers, guerrillas, or deserters of the
Mosby, Gilmor, and Clanton style; while the women were the
imitators and admirers of Belle Boyd, Rosa Greenhow, and
Sallie Rochester Ford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still this class, making up in noise and bluster for what
they lacked in numbers and ability, and possessing a sort of
recklessness, dash, and <em>abandon</em>, which has always been attractive
to the excitable and half-educated people of the South,
have succeeding in keeping up an excitement, and an explosive
condition of society, very unfavorable to the restoration
of quiet, industry, and good order. Whether intentionally or
not, the course pursued by President Johnson was admirably
calculated to foster just this state of feeling. He commenced
his administration by a very great blunder,—the refusal to
call an extra session of Congress in the summer of 1865.
The emergency was one which demanded the assembling of
the national legislature, and the harmonious and wise co-operation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>of the executive and legislative branches of the
government in the restoration of law, order, and quiet,
throughout the nation. Nothing save the overweening vanity
and conceit of Andrew Johnson led him to neglect this
obvious duty, and to assume to himself powers which the constitution
had never granted to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beginning with this mistake, let us briefly review his subsequent
history so far as it relates to reconstruction, and see
how it continued to be “a tragedy of errors.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In June, 1865, delegates from the South were first admitted
to private interviews with the President. On the
17th of June, he issued his proclamation, providing for the
restoration of civil government in Georgia and Alabama, in
which he excluded negroes from the category of loyal citizens
entitled to vote. He soon after proceeded to appoint provisional
governors for the Southern States,—an entirely unwarrantable
proceeding. The character of these appointments
may be seen in a sentiment uttered by Governor
Perry, one of the number, soon after his installation. “There
is not now in the Southern States,” said he, “any one who
feels more bitterly the humiliation and degradation of going
back into the Union than I do.” He ingratiated himself in
the favor of the President, by assuring the people that the
death of Mr. Lincoln was no loss to the South, while he had
every hope that the accession of Mr. Johnson, an old slave-holding
Democrat, would be an advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Alabama, under the provisional government established
by Mr. Johnson, the Convention prohibited negroes from testifying
in the courts. Throughout the South, the unrepentant
rebels began at once to make their arrangements for
taking part in the government. In November, Governor
Perry, of South Carolina, made a public demand, that when
Congress met, the clerk of the House should place on the roll
the names of representatives from the States lately in rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>When South Carolina hesitated to adopt the constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery, President Johnson assured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>the Governor, that the clause giving Congress power to enforce
it by appropriate legislation, really limited Congressional
control over the negro question. After this preposterous assurance,
South Carolina accepted the constitutional amendment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August and September, 1865, Democratic conventions
indorsed the President’s policy, and Democratic papers (even
those which six months before denounced him as a drunken
boor, and demanded his resignation) began to praise him.
The Republican party were yet unwilling to believe that the
man whom they had elected to the Vice-Presidency would so
grossly deceive and betray them, and hoped that after the assembling
of Congress all differences would disappear.</p>

<p class='c000'>They found very soon, however, that this hope was vain;
for when the Thirty-ninth Congress was organized for business,
and the message of the President was read, it was seen
that he placed himself in direct opposition to the leaders of
the Republican party, and utterly at variance with what he
had at first avowed as his own policy. He professed his inability
to concede the elective franchise to the freedmen in the
South, because he must then of necessity have conceded it
also to all colored men in the Northern States. A parity of
reasoning would have required him to appoint provisional
governors over all the Northern States, because he appointed
them in the States lately in rebellion. While Congress was
in session, and actually employed in legislating for the restoration
of the rebel States, Mr. Johnson removed the Provisional
Governor of Alabama, and handed the State government
over to the officers elected by the people, thus ignoring
the right of Congress to exercise any control over the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to the demand of the Senate for information respecting
the condition of the rebel States, the President sent a
message professing that they were all in a quiet and peaceful
condition, and accompanied it by the reports of Generals
Grant and Carl Schurz, which disproved his statements. Mr.
Sumner denounced this as an attempt to “whitewash” their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>actual condition, and he was correct, though at the time
severely denounced for the use of that term.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Freedmen’s Bureau Bill was passed by a large majority
of both houses of Congress, about the first of February; but
was vetoed by the President on the 19th of February; and on
the effort to pass it over the veto, six senators who had voted
for it at first, receded and sustained the President’s veto. This
was Mr. Johnson’s first and last triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days later, on the 22d of February (1866), a day
most unpropitious in his subsequent history, Mr. Johnson
addressed to a noisy gathering which had assembled to serenade
him, a most disgraceful speech, in which he denounced
Senator Sumner and Representative Thaddeus Stevens by
name, declaring that they were seeking to assassinate him,
and indulged in the use of grossly insulting epithets toward
other prominent men. This speech, for which his friends
apologized, on the plea that he was intoxicated, seriously
damaged the President’s cause, while it widened the breach
between him and the party to whom he owed his advancement.
Henceforward Congress moved cautiously but firmly.
Every bill relating to reconstruction was carefully considered
and thoroughly matured before its passage, and when the inevitable
veto came, each bill was triumphantly passed over it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first measure to undergo this ordeal was the <span class='sc'>Civil
Rights Bill</span>, passed March 13, 1866; vetoed by the President
March 27, 1866; and passed over his veto, by 33 yeas
to 15 nays in the Senate; and 122 yeas to 41 nays in the
House, April 6–9, 1866.</p>

<p class='c000'>This bill, the first of the permanent measures of reconstruction
on the Congressional plan, provided that all persons born
in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power,
excluding Indians not taxed, should be declared and considered
citizens of the United States, and that such citizens of
every race and color, without regard to any previous condition
of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime whereof the party had been duly convicted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>should have the same right in every State and Territory of the
United States to make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties,
and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,
and convey real and personal property; and to full and equal
benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person
and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and be subject to
like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any
law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>It further provided for the punishment of all infractions of
this act, and for its effectual enforcement, through the district
courts of the United States and their officers; and authorized
the President, or any persons whom he might empower, to
prevent the violation of the act, and if necessary to call the
land or naval forces of the United States, or the militia, to aid
in preventing such violation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next measure of Congress looking toward reconstruction,
was the passage and submission to the State legislatures
of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United
States. This amendment passed the Senate June 8, 1866,
by a vote of 33 yeas to 11 nays; and the House, June 13,
1866, by 138 yeas to 36 nays. The following is the joint
resolution and amendment:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>“Joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</em> (two thirds of both Houses
concurring), That the following article be proposed to the legislatures
of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, which, when ratified by three fourths of said legislatures,
shall be valid as part of the Constitution, namely:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Article 14.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> All persons born or naturalized in the United States,
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> Representatives shall be apportioned among the several
States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole
number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But
when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for
President and Vice-President of the United States, representatives
in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or the
members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male
inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens
of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation
in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation
therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such
male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one
years of age in such State.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> No person shall be a senator or representative in
Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any
office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State,
who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or
as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature,
or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support
the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection
or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the
enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of
each house, remove such disability.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> The validity of the public debt of the United States,
authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions
and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion,
shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any
State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of
insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for
the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations,
and claims shall be held illegal and void.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this article.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 2d of July, 1866, the Senate, and on the 3d of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>July, the House, passed a second Freedmen’s Bureau Bill,
continuing in force the original bill of March 3, 1865, for two
years from the passage of this act, and providing more definitely
for its administration, and the bestowment of its aid
upon the freedmen and loyal refugees (the first bill having
been somewhat loose in these particulars). It also prescribed
in certain emergencies for the exercise of military protection,
and jurisdiction to the freedmen, as the wards of the nation,
by the commissioner and his assistants.</p>

<p class='c000'>This bill Mr. Johnson, after repeated pledges that he would
not do so, vetoed, on the 16th of July, 1866, and it was passed
over the veto in both houses of Congress the same day: in the
House by 103 yeas to 33 nays; and in the Senate by 33
yeas to 12 nays. On the 23d of July, Congress passed the following
joint resolution to restore Tennessee to the Union:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whereas, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-one, the government
of the State of Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession
of by persons in hostility to the United States, and the inhabitants
of said State, in pursuance of an act of Congress, were
declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States;
and whereas said State government can only be restored to its
former political relations in the Union by the consent of the lawmaking
power of the United States; and whereas the people of said
State did, on the twenty-second day of February, eighteen hundred
and sixty-five, by a large popular vote, adopt and ratify a constitution
of government whereby slavery was abolished, and all ordinances
and laws of secession, and debts contracted under the same,
were declared void; and whereas a State government has been organized
under said constitution which has ratified the amendment to
the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery, also the
amendment proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and has done
other acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty; Therefore,</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the State of
Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper, practical relations
to the Union, and is again entitled to be represented by senators
and representatives in Congress.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>This joint resolution passed the Senate, 28 yeas to 4 nays;
and the House, 93 yeas to 26 nays. As a joint resolution it
did not require the President’s signature to make it valid, but
he addressed a message to Congress stating that he had signed
it, but protesting against what he professed to regard as its
anomalous features. With this act, the reconstruction measures
of the first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress concluded.
They were a good beginning in the work, but were
not, and their authors did not regard them as, a complete system
of reconstruction. The work was to be perfected in subsequent
sessions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Occurrences were transpiring, meanwhile, which were destined
to have an influence on this subject. In May, 1866, a
collision took place between some discharged negro soldiers,
and the police of Memphis, Tennessee (which was composed
to a large extent of rebel soldiers and officers, and of Irishmen,
whose hatred of the negro was intense); and this culminated
in a riot which lasted two or three days, and resulted
in the murder of twenty-four negroes, the serious wounding
of more than one hundred, many of whom subsequently died
of their wounds, and the destruction of property to the amount
of about $120,000, mostly negro dwellings, churches, and
school-houses. On the side of the police one white man was
wounded, it was alleged by the negroes, but, as was afterward
ascertained, by another policeman. The real question at
issue here was, the right of the freedman to the same privileges
and immunities as the white. For this atrocious massacre of
the nation’s wards, Mr. Johnson had no word of censure.
On the 30th of July, at New Orleans, the Constitutional Convention
of 1864, being revived and reconvened by Governor
Wells, commenced its session at the Mechanics’ Institute,
when they were set upon by the police (nine tenths of them
unrepentant rebels), under the prompting of Mayor Monroe,
the same man who was mayor in 1862, when New Orleans
was captured, and Attorney-General Herron, another rebel
officer. The police first assaulted a procession of colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>men, who were marching to the Institute, and by firing upon
them, compelled them to attempt their own defence (though
not one in ten had any weapons). The police murdered a number,
and drove the rest before them into the Institute, when
they commenced an indiscriminate firing upon the members
of the Convention, who were unarmed, though they raised at
once a white flag. Several of these were killed, and others
mortally wounded, among the number, Rev. J. W. Horton,
who had acted as chaplain of the Convention, and Dr. A. P.
Dostie, a prominent Union man. In all, 27 were killed outright,
and over eighty wounded, many of them mortally. Of
the policemen, and their abettors, forty-two were either killed
or wounded. General Sheridan, the commander of the Fifth
Military District, was at this time absent in Texas, having
been assured beforehand by Monroe and Herron that there
would be no disturbance and no violence. General Baird,
who was in command at the time, seemed irresolute, and did
not attempt any movement until too late to do any good.
General Sheridan, on his return, examined into the affair, and
on the 2d of August reported to General Grant, that “it
was an absolute massacre by the police, which was not excelled
in murderous cruelty by that of Fort Pillow. It was a
murder which the mayor and police of the city perpetrated
without the shadow of a necessity; furthermore, I believe it
was premeditated, and every indication points to this. I
recommend the removing of this bad man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Monroe and Herron, and their party, insisted that they had
the sanction of the President in all their conduct; and the
telegraphic despatches of the President to Herron, and to
General Baird; his permitting, if he did not direct, the garbling
of Sheridan’s despatches; his attempted justification
of Monroe and Herron, and his effort to throw the blame on
Congress, at St. Louis, and subsequently on Secretary Stanton,
gave good reason to believe their statement true.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attempt to revive this defunct convention may have
been injudicious; some of the men who took part in it, especially
Governor Wells and R. Cutler King, may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>bad men—demagogues; but it was an honest effort on the
part of the great majority of the delegates (whether wise or
not) to reorganize the State on a loyal basis, and in accordance
with the Congressional plan of reconstruction; and this
was sufficient to arouse Mr. Johnson’s hostility to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next act in the drama was the Philadelphia Convention,
called, by those who summoned it, the National Union
Convention, which met in that city, August 14, 1866, responsive
to a call signed by Messrs. A. W. Randall, J. R. Doolittle,
O. H. Browning, Edgar Cowan, Charles Knapp, and Samuel
Fowler; as Executive Committee of the National Union
Club, and indorsed by Senators Norton, Nesmith, Dixon, and
Hendricks. The object of this convention was to rally to the
support of the President a considerable portion (a majority it
was hoped) of both parties upon a so-called conservative platform,
which should be sufficiently comprehensive to accommodate
the Semi-Republicans, the War-Democrats, Peace-Democrats,
and the half-repentant Rebels. General J. A. Dix was
chosen temporary, and Senator Doolittle, permanent President
of the Convention, and Mr. Henry J. Raymond, of the “New
York Times,” was made Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the opening of the Convention, General Couch, of Massachusetts,
a former corps commander in the Army of the
Potomac, and Ex-Governor Orr, of South Carolina, came in
arm-in-arm, “at which scene,” said the reporters, “every eye
was suffused with tears.” The Convention, however, proved
a failure. The elements were too discordant to mingle readily;
and though Mr. Raymond proposed a very plausible and
neatly worded address and series of resolutions, and Messrs.
Doolittle, Cowan, and others, spoke very eloquently in favor
of harmony and union on the President’s policy, the influence
of the affair on the nation was positively nothing, and the
prime movers in it, who had been Republicans, found themselves
read out of their own party, and not received cordially
by the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Johnson had for some months been receiving delegations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>of all sorts of men, and expressing his opinions on political
questions with great freedom, though not always with consistency
or coherence. On receiving a committee from the
Philadelphia Convention, who, through their chairman, Hon.
Reverdy Johnson, presented their proceedings, he made one
of his characteristic speeches, full of references to himself, his
feelings and emotions, his weeping at the touching scene in
the Convention, and allusions to “the humble individual who
was then addressing them,” and spoke of Congress in these
words: “We have seen hanging upon the verge of the government,
as it were, a body called, or which assumes to be,
the Congress of the United States, while in fact it is a Congress
of only a part of the States. We have seen this Congress
pretend to be for the Union, when its every step and act
tended to perpetuate disunion, and make a disruption of the
States inevitable. Instead of promoting reconciliation and
harmony, its legislation has partaken of the character of penalties,
retaliation, and revenge. This has been the course and
the policy of one portion of your government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such unwarrantable charges against a coördinate department
of the government, were not only in bad taste, but
tended to bring the two into speedy collision; and it was due
rather to the great patience and forbearance of Congress, than
to any circumspection on the part of Mr. Johnson, that a revolution
was not precipitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came that journey to Chicago, professedly to lay the
corner-stone of the monument to the late Hon. Stephen A.
Douglas, but really intended as a political canvass in behalf
of what Mr. Johnson called his “policy.” This disgraceful
expedition, aptly termed, from one of his own pet expressions,
“swinging round the circle,” was to every loyal American
the most humiliating exhibition ever made by any public man
in this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Washington on the 28th of August, he proceeded
northward, accompanied by Secretaries Seward and Welles,
Postmaster-General Randall, General Grant, Admiral Farragut,
and others, a part of whom, however, left the party some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>time before it reached its destination. At every point of his
progress, which was by way of Philadelphia, New York,
Albany, the New York Central and Lake Shore roads to
Chicago, and thence to St. Louis, Louisville, Indianapolis,
and Cincinnati, he seized upon the opportunity to make a
speech, and in many places was speedily involved in a wordy
wrangle with the crowd, in which he invariably became angry,
and exhibited a proficiency in the use of Billingsgate that
might have done credit to a fishwoman, but was simply shameful
in the chief magistrate of the United States. We cannot
consent to defile our pages with specimens of the venom and
abuse, which sometimes was almost blasphemous in its character,
with which his twenty or thirty speeches during this
tour were so freely interlarded. They are too fresh in the
minds of the people, and have formed recently one of the
counts in the indictment with which a long-suffering people
have visited this public offender.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the abusive portions of these speeches were the only
parts of them which were readable. The dreary platitudes
about “the humble individual who now addresses you,” the
ineffable conceit which on every occasion rehearsed the fact
that “he had filled every station from alderman of a small
country village to his present exalted station,” the gravity
with which he stated at every railway station that he “left
the Constitution of the United States, and the flag with thirty-six
stars in their hands,” became at last so intolerably wearisome,
that nobody could wade through the mass of dullness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elections of the autumn of 1866, which immediately
succeeded this tour, proved most conclusively the growing disgust
of the people for-the man who occupied the presidential
chair. The Thirty-ninth Congress had been strongly Republican;
the Fortieth was overwhelmingly so; and wherever
Johnson had addressed the public, there the Republican majorities
were unprecedented. The reconstruction measures
which Congress had adopted, were sanctioned by the people,
and others of a more decided character completing the work,
were urged upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The elections of the Autumn of 1866 had greatly
strengthened and encouraged the Republican majority in
Congress, and when the members of the Thirty-ninth Congress
met in their second session in December, 1866, they
were resolved to complete their work of reconstruction, so far
as it was possible to do so, and to pass the necessary bills over
the President’s veto. The minority (Democrats) were weak
in numbers in both houses, but they numbered several men
of very considerable ability, and they had been reënforced by
the defection from the Republicans of Messrs. Cowan, Doolittle,
Dixon, and Norton in the Senate, and Mr. Raymond,
and two or three others, on some questions, in the House.
Their losses by death and by the unseating of several members
whose seats were contested, however, gave them really
very little more available strength than in the previous session,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>while the Republicans were united and thoroughly in
earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first measure adopted during the session, having a
bearing on the question of reconstruction, was the bill regulating
the elective franchise in the District of Columbia.
This was a measure of great importance, as, the District of
Columbia being under the exclusive government of Congress,
the action of that body in regard to conferring the suffrage and
other privileges of citizenship upon the negro there, would indicate
distinctly what Congress would require from the Rebel
States as conditions precedent to their admission into the
Union. Its provisions were as follows: Sec. 1 confers
the elective franchise on male citizens of the United States,
twenty-one years old and upward without distinction on account
of race or color, who shall have resided in the District
one year next preceding any election therein, excepting paupers,
persons under guardianship, those convicted of any
infamous crime or offense, and those who may have voluntarily
given aid and comfort to the Rebels in the late Rebellion.
Sec. 2 provides that any person whose duty it shall
be to receive votes at any election within the District of
Columbia, who shall reject the vote of any person entitled to
vote under this act, shall be liable to an action of tort by the
person injured, and on indictment and conviction, to a fine
not exceeding $5,000, or to imprisonment not exceeding one
year in the jail of the District, or both. Sec. 3 provides
that any one willfully disturbing an elector in the exercise of
such franchise shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction,
shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000, or an
imprisonment not exceeding thirty days in the jail of the
District, or both. Sec. 4 makes it the duty of criminal
courts in the District to give this act in special charge to the
grand jury at the common circuit of each term of the court.
Secs. 5 and 6. The voting lists are to be prepared by the
mayors and aldermen of the cities of Washington and
Georgetown on and before the first day of March in each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>year, and are to be posted in public places ten days before the
annual election. The remaining four sections give other
prescriptions as to the manner in which the election shall be
held.</p>

<p class='c000'>This bill passed the Senate December 14, 1866, by a vote
of 32 yeas to 13 nays; and the House by 128 yeas to 46 nays.
Mr. Johnson vetoed it in a very elaborate message, on the 7th
of January, 1867; and the same day the Senate passed it again
over the veto, by yeas 29, nays 10; and the next day, the
House followed their example by yeas 113, nays 38.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 14th of January, 1867, a bill was sent to the President,
which had previously passed both houses of Congress by
a large majority, which provided that from and after its passage
there should be no denial of the elective franchise in any of
the territories of the United States, now, or hereafter to be
organized, to any citizen thereof, on account of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude; and all acts or parts of acts,
either of Congress or the legislative assemblies of said territories,
inconsistent with the provisions of this act, are declared
null and void.</p>

<p class='c000'>This bill, not being returned by the President within ten
days, became a law on the 24th of January, 1867.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next measure was the admission of Nebraska as a
State, with the condition that the new State should by a
solemn act assent to the provision that there should be no
denial within the State of the elective franchise, or of any
other right to any person, by reason of race or color, excepting
Indians not taxed. This was vetoed by the President,
but passed over his veto, February 9.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of reconstruction proper, as applied to the
States lately in insurrection, was one of greater difficulty.
Several bills were presented in both houses, and very considerable
differences of opinion evidently existed among the
Republican members. So serious were these at one time as
to make it doubtful whether any measure which would be
generally satisfactory could be passed during the session. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>bill at length passed the House, for abrogating the existing
provisional governments in the Rebel States, and establishing
military rule there, dividing the whole Southern territory into
five military districts, and conferring upon the General-in-chief
the power of appointing the commanders of these districts.
This bill was materially modified, or rather, another bill, combining
with it reconstruction measures, and placing the appointing
power in the hands of the President, was presented
in the Senate, by Senator Sherman of Ohio, which passed
that body. To this the House disagreed, and voted to adhere
to its original bill. After some time, however, the House receded,
and added some important amendments to Sherman’s
bill, which was then passed by both houses; the vote in the
House being 128 yeas to 46 nays, and that in the Senate, 35
yeas to 7 nays.</p>

<p class='c000'>This measure was one of such importance that we deem it
necessary to give the text of it in full. It is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>An Act</span> to provide efficient Government for the Insurrectionary
States.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Whereas</em>, No legal State governments or adequate protection for
life or property now exist in the Rebel States of Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Florida, Texas, and Arkansas; <em>and whereas</em>, it is necessary that
peace and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal
and republican State governments can be legally established; therefore,</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Be it enacted, etc.</em>, That said Rebel States shall be divided into
military districts, and made subject to the military authority of the
United States, as hereinafter mentioned; and for that purpose Virginia
shall constitute the First District; North Carolina and South
Carolina the Second District; Georgia, Alabama, and Florida the
Third District; Mississippi and Arkansas the Fourth District; and
Louisiana and Texas the Fifth District.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> That it shall be the duty of the President to assign
to the command of each of said districts an officer of the army not
below the rank of Brigadier-General, and to detail a sufficient military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>force to enable such officer to perform his duties and enforce
his authority within the district to which he is assigned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> That it shall be the duty of each officer assigned as
aforesaid to protect all persons in their rights of person and
property; to suppress insurrection, disorder, and violence; and to
punish or cause to be punished all disturbers of the public peace
and criminals; and to this end he may allow local civil tribunals to
take jurisdiction of and try offenders, or, when in his judgment it
may be necessary for the trial of offenders, he shall have power to
organize military committees or tribunals for that purpose; and all
interference under color of State authority with the exercise of
military authority under this act shall be null and void.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> That all persons put under military arrest by virtue
of this act shall be tried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel or
unusual punishment shall be inflicted; and no sentence of any military
commission or tribunal hereby authorized affecting the life or
liberty of any person shall be executed until it is approved by the
officer in command of the district; and the laws and regulations for
the government of the army shall not be affected by this act, except
in so far as they may conflict with its provisions. <em>Provided</em>, That
no sentence of death under this act shall be carried into execution
without the approval of the President.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> When the people of any one of said Rebel States
shall have formed a constitution and government in conformity with
the Constitution of the United States in all respects, framed by a
convention of delegates elected by the male citizens of said State, 21
years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition,
who have been resident in said State for one year previous to the
day of such election, except such as may be disfranchised for participation
in the Rebellion, or for felony at common law, and when
such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be
enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated
for electors of delegates, and when such constitution shall be ratified
by a majority of the persons voting on the question of ratification
who are qualified as electors for delegates, and when such constitution
shall have been submitted to Congress for examination and
approval, and Congress shall have approved the same, and when
said State by a vote of its legislature elected under said constitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>shall have adopted the amendment to the Constitution of the
United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as
Article 14, and when said article shall have become part of the Constitution
of the United States, said State shall be declared entitled
to representation in Congress, and Senators and Representatives
shall be admitted therefrom, on their taking the oath prescribed by
law, and then and thereafter the preceding sections of this act shall
be inoperative in said State. <em>Provided</em>, That no person excluded
from the privilege of holding office by said proposed amendment to
the Constitution of the United States shall be eligible to election as
a member of the convention to frame a constitution for any of said
Rebel States, nor shall any such person vote for members of such
convention.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 6.</span> Until the people of the said Rebel States shall by law
be admitted to representation to the Congress of the United States,
all civil governments that may exist therein shall be deemed provisional
only, and shall be in all respects subject to the paramount
authority of the United States, at any time to abolish, modify, control,
and supersede the same, and in all elections to any office under
such provisional governments all persons shall be entitled to vote
under the provisions of the fifth section of this act. And no person
shall be eligible to any office under such provisional governments
who would be disqualified from holding office under the provisions
of the third article of said Constitutional Amendment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This act completes the reconstruction measures properly so
called, of the Thirty-ninth Congress. One other bill, passed
by that Congress, at its second session, demands notice in this
connection, from its purpose, and its subsequent bearing on the
question of impeachment. The due and active enforcement
of the reconstruction measures passed by Congress over the
President’s veto, depended in a great degree upon the Secretary
of War. It was known that Mr. Johnson would not be
remarkably zealous in compelling obedience to them, though
it was not known, till some months later, that he would counsel
their violation, on the ground of his belief or impression that
they were unconstitutional. But of the fidelity and loyalty
of Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War, the Republicans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>in Congress had no question, and their only apprehension was
that Mr. Johnson would discharge him from his cabinet, and
place in the department some supple tool of his own, whose
whole effort would be to nullify these measures which they
regarded as so important. There were others, too, in administrative
positions, especially in connection with the Freedmen’s
Bureau, who were liable to removal for no other
offense than that of an honest effort to administer the laws
in letter and spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>To prevent the exercise of this arbitrary power by the
President, the Tenure of Office Act was matured, and passed
the Senate February 18, 1867, by yeas 22, nays 10; and the
House, February 19, by yeas 112, nays 41. It was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>An Act</span> regulating the Tenure of certain Civil Offices.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That every person
holding any civil office to which he has been appointed by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, and every person who shall
hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall become duly
qualified to act therein, is, and shall be, entitled to hold such office
until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly
qualified, except as herein otherwise provided: <em>Provided</em>, That the
Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy, and of
the Interior, the Postmaster-General, and the Attorney-General
shall hold their offices respectively for and during the term of the
President by whom they may have been appointed, and for one
month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 2.</span> That when any officer appointed as aforesaid, excepting
judges of the United States courts, shall, during the recess of the
Senate, be shown, by evidence satisfactory to the President, to be
guilty of misconduct in office, or crime, or for any reason shall become
incapable or legally disqualified to perform its duties, in such case,
and in no other, the President may suspend such officer, and designate
some suitable person to perform temporarily the duties of such
office until the next meeting of the Senate, and until the case shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>be acted upon by the Senate; and such person, so designated, shall
take the oaths and give the bonds required by law to be taken and
given by the person duly appointed to fill such office; and in such
case it shall be the duty of the President, within twenty days after
the first day of such next meeting of the Senate, to report to the
Senate such suspension, with the evidence and reasons for his action
in the case, and the name of the person so designated to perform the
duties of such office. And if the Senate shall concur in such suspension,
and advise and consent to the removal of such officer, they
shall so certify to the President, who may thereupon remove such
officer, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint
another person to such office. But if the Senate shall refuse
to concur in such suspension, such officer so suspended shall forthwith
resume the functions of his office, and the powers of the person
so performing its duties in his stead shall cease, and the official
salary and emoluments of such officer shall, during such suspension,
belong to the person so performing the duties thereof, and not to the
officer so suspended: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the President, in case
he shall become satisfied that such suspension was made on insufficient
grounds, shall be authorized, at any time before reporting such
suspension to the Senate as above provided, to revoke such suspension,
and reinstate such officer in the performance of the duties of his
office.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 3.</span> That the President shall have power to fill all
vacancies which may happen during the recess of the Senate, by
reason of death or resignation, by granting commissions which shall
expire at the end of their next session thereafter. And if no appointment,
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall
be made to such office so vacant or temporarily filled as aforesaid
during such next session of the Senate, such office shall remain in
abeyance without any salary, fees, or emoluments attached thereto,
until the same shall be filled by appointment thereto, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate; and during such time all the
powers and duties belonging to such office shall be exercised by such
other officer, as may by law exercise such powers and duties in case
of a vacancy in such office.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 4.</span> That nothing in this act contained shall be construed
to extend the term of any office the duration of which is
limited by law.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>“<span class='sc'>Section 5.</span> That if any person shall, contrary to the provisions
of this act, accept any appointment to or employment in any office,
or shall hold or exercise, or attempt to hold or exercise, any such
office or employment, he shall be deemed, and is hereby declared to
be, guilty of a high misdemeanor, and, upon trial and conviction
thereof, he shall be punished therefor by a fine not exceeding ten
thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding five years, or
both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 6.</span> That every removal, appointment, or employment
made, had, or exercised, contrary to the provisions of this act, and
the making, signing, sealing, countersigning, or issuing of any commission
or letter of authority for or in respect to any such appointment
or employment, shall be deemed, and are hereby declared to
be, high misdemeanors, and, upon trial and conviction thereof, every
person guilty thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten
thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding five years, or
both said punishments, in the discretion of the court: <em>Provided</em>,
That the President shall have power to make out and deliver, after
the adjournment of the Senate, commissions for all officers whose
appointment shall have been advised and consented to by the
Senate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 7.</span> That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the
Senate, at the close of each session thereof, to deliver to the Secretary
of the Treasury, and to each of his assistants, and to each of
the Auditors, and to each of the Comptrollers in the Treasury, and
to the Treasurer, and to the Register of the Treasury, a full and
complete list, duly certified, of all persons who shall have been
nominated to and rejected by the Senate during such session, and a
like list of all the offices to which nominations shall have been
made and not confirmed and filled at such session.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 8.</span> That whenever the President shall, without the advice
and consent of the Senate, designate, authorize, or employ
any person to perform the duties of any office, he shall forthwith
notify the Secretary of the Treasury thereof, and it shall be
the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury thereupon to communicate
such notice to all the proper accounting and disbursing
officers of his Department.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Section 9.</span> That no money shall be paid or received from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>Treasury, or paid or received from or retained out of any public
moneys or funds of the United States, whether in the Treasury or
not, to or by or for the benefit of any person appointed to or authorized
to act in or holding or exercising the duties or functions of any
office contrary to the provisions of this act; nor shall any claim, account,
voucher, order, certificate, warrant, or other instrument providing
for or relating to such payment, receipt, or retention, be
presented, passed, allowed, approved, certified, or paid by any officer
of the United States, or by any person exercising the functions or
performing the duties of any office or place of trust under the United
States, for or in respect to such office, or the exercising or performing
the functions or duties thereof; and every person who shall
violate any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of
a high misdemeanor, and upon trial and conviction thereof, shall be
punished therefor by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, or by
imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or both said punishments, in
the discretion of the court.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The action of Congress in bestowing the franchise, without
distinction of race or color, on the inhabitants of the District
of Columbia, speedily exerted an influence in other sections.
On the 6th of February, 1867, the lower branch of the Tennessee
Legislature passed a bill striking the word “white” from
the franchise law of the State, by yeas 38, nays 25. On the
18th of February the State Senate concurred, by yeas 14,
nays 7. On the 21st of March, the Supreme Court of the
State unanimously sustained the constitutionality of the franchise
law as thus amended, and in August following, the negroes,
for the first time, exercised the franchise, at the election
for governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the passage of the Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867,
the Republicans of the Thirty-ninth Congress had not fully
come up to the positions which it was their duty to occupy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bill too was somewhat loosely drawn, and some supplementary
legislation was necessary to give it force and efficacy.
It was, perhaps, the best that could be done under
the circumstances, for they were embarrassed by the diversity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>of opinions on many of the details of reconstruction,
among the Republicans themselves, and by the fact, that any
very stringent measure could not be passed over the veto
which was sure to come. The Fortieth Congress, which was
called together by the officers of its predecessor on the 4th of
March, 1867, was fresh from the people, and stronger and
more positive in its convictions. One of the measures taken
up at its short session of March, 1867, was a supplementary
Reconstruction Act, which passed both houses on the 19th
of March. This was vetoed March 23, and the same day
passed over the veto; in the House by 114 yeas to 25 nays,
and in the Senate by 40 yeas to 7 nays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are the main provisions of this act:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before September 1, 1867, the commanding general in each district,
defined by an act entitled ‘An Act to provide for the more Efficient
Government of the Rebel States,’ passed March 2, 1867, shall
cause a registration to be made of the male citizens of the United
States, twenty-one years of age and upwards, resident in each county
or parish in the State or States included in his district, which registration
shall include only those persons who are qualified to vote for delegates
by the act aforesaid, and who shall have taken and subscribed the
following oath or affirmation: ‘I, ——, do solemnly swear (or affirm),
in the presence of Almighty God, that I am a citizen of the State of ——;
that I have resided in said State for —— months next preceding
this day, and now reside in the county of ——, or the parish
of ——, in said State (as the case may be); that I am twenty-one
years old; that I have not been disfranchised for participation
in any rebellion or civil war against the United States, nor for felony
committed against the laws of any State or of the United States;
that I have never been a member of any State legislature, nor held
any executive or judicial office in any State and afterwards engaged
in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid
or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I have never taken an oath
as a member of Congress of the United States, or as an officer of the
United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive
or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution
of the United States, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to the
enemies thereof; that I will faithfully support the Constitution and
obey the laws of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability,
encourage others so to do, so help me God;’ which oath or affirmation
may be administered by any registering officer. <span class='sc'>Sec. 2.</span>
After the completion of the registration hereby provided for in any
State, at such time and places therein as the commanding general
shall appoint and direct, of which at least thirty days’ public notice
shall be given, an election shall be held of delegates to a convention
for the purpose of establishing a constitution and civil government for
such State loyal to the Union, said convention in each State, except
Virginia, to consist of the same number of members as the most
numerous branch of the State legislature of such State in the year
1860, to be apportioned among the several districts, counties, or parishes
of such State by the commanding general, giving to each representation
in the ratio of voters registered as aforesaid, as nearly as
may be. The convention in Virginia shall consist of the same number
of members as represented the territory now constituting Virginia
in the most numerous branch of the legislature of said State in
the year 1860, to be apportioned as aforesaid. <span class='sc'>Sec. 3.</span> At said
election the registered voters of each State shall vote for or against
a convention to form a constitution therefor under this act. The
person appointed to superintend said election, and to make return of
the votes given thereat, as herein provided, shall count and make return
of the votes given for and against a convention; and the commanding
general to whom the same shall have been returned shall
ascertain and declare the total vote in each State for and against a
convention. If a majority of the votes given on that question shall
be for a convention, then such convention shall be held as hereinafter
provided; but if a majority of said votes shall be against a convention,
then no such convention shall be held under this act: <em>Provided</em>,
that such convention shall not be held unless a majority of all
such registered voters shall have voted on the question of holding
such convention. <span class='sc'>Sec. 4.</span> The commanding general of each district
shall appoint as many boards of registration as may be necessary,
consisting of three loyal officers or persons, to make and
complete the registration, superintend the election, and make return
to him of the votes, lists of voters, and of the persons elected as delegates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>by a plurality of the votes cast at said election; and upon receiving
said returns he shall open the same, ascertain the persons
elected as delegates according to the returns of the officers who conducted
said election, and make proclamation thereof; and if a majority
of the votes given on that question shall be for a convention,
the commanding general, within sixty days from the date of election,
shall notify the delegates to assemble in convention, at a time
and place to be mentioned in the notification, and said convention,
when organized, shall proceed to frame a constitution and civil government
according to the provisions of this act and the act to which
it is supplementary; and when the same shall have been so framed,
said constitution shall be submitted by the convention for ratification
to the persons registered under the provisions of this act, at an election
to be conducted by the officers or persons appointed or to be appointed
by the commanding general, as hereinbefore provided, and
to be held after the expiration of thirty days from the date of notice
thereof, to be given by said convention; and the returns thereof shall
be made to the commanding general of the district. <span class='sc'>Sec. 5.</span> That
if, according to said returns, the constitution shall be ratified by a
majority of the votes of the registered electors qualified as herein
specified, cast at said election (at least one half of all the registered
voters voting upon the question of such ratification), the president
of the convention shall transmit a copy of the same, duly certified, to
the President of the United States, who shall forthwith transmit the
same to Congress, if then in session, and if not in session, then immediately
upon its next assembling; and if it shall, moreover, appear
to Congress, that the election was one at which all the registered
and qualified electors in the State had an opportunity to vote freely
and without restraint, fear, or the influence of fraud, and if the Congress
shall be satisfied that such constitution meets the approval of a
majority of all the qualified electors in the State, and if the said constitution
shall be declared by Congress to be in conformity with the
provisions of the act to which this is supplementary, and the other
provisions of said act shall have been complied with, and the said
constitution shall be approved by Congress, the State shall be declared
entitled to representation, and Senators and Representatives
shall be admitted therefrom as therein provided. <span class='sc'>Sec. 6.</span> All elections
in the States mentioned in the said ‘Act to provide for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>more efficient Government of the Rebel States,’ shall, during the
operation of said act, be by ballot; and all officers making the said
registration of voters and conducting said elections shall, before entering
upon the discharge of their duties, take and subscribe the oath
prescribed by the Act approved July 2, 1862, entitled ‘An Act to
prescribe an Oath of Office:’ <em>Provided</em>, That if any person shall
knowingly and falsely take and subscribe any oath in this act prescribed,
such person so offending and being thereof duly convicted,
shall be subject to the pains, penalties, and disabilities which by law
are provided for the punishment of the crime of wilful and corrupt
perjury.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Johnson promised to carry out this act faithfully, but
the Republican leaders had seen so often how little dependence
was to be placed upon his pledges, that they did not
think it prudent to adjourn without making provision for the
calling of a Summer Session, should it prove to be necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The event proved that this was a wise and needful precaution.
In direct contradiction to his promises, Congress had
hardly adjourned before Mr. Johnson procured from his Attorney-General,
Mr. Stanbery, a series of opinions in regard to
the Reconstruction Acts, in which, with a lawyer’s ingenuity,
they were wrested from their plain and obvious meaning, and
explained to be merely measures of military police, of no particular
importance. The first of these opinions, bearing date
May 24, the President had forwarded to the various military
commanders, accompanied with a note calling their attention to
it. It was his obvious intention, though he was too disingenuous
to say so distinctly, that it should be regarded as mandatory;
and by this device he hoped to annul the Reconstruction Acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>This artful trick rendered it necessary to summon Congress
to meet on the 4th of July, 1867, and they promptly passed
another supplementary Reconstruction Act, in terms so plain
and unmistakable that even the Attorney-General could not
subvert its meaning, and the execution of the act was conferred
on the General-in-chief and the commanders of the
military districts, instead of the President. This act was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>passed July 13, in the Senate by a vote of 31 to 6; in the
House by 111 to 23. Mr. Johnson vetoed it (of course) on
the 19th of July, and it was at once passed over the veto; in
the Senate by a vote of 30 to 6, in the House by 100 to 22.
The bill was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 1.</span> That it is hereby declared to have been the true intent
and meaning of the Act of the 2d day of March, 1867, entitled ‘An
Act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,’
and the act supplementary thereto, passed the 23d of March, 1867,
that the governments then existing in the Rebel States of Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama,
Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and Arkansas, were not legal State
governments; and that thereafter said governments, if continued,
were to be continued subject in all respects to the military commanders
of the respective districts, and to the paramount authority
of Congress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 2.</span> That the commander of any district named in said act
shall have power, subject to the disapproval of the General of the
army of the United States, and to have effect until disapproved,
whenever, in the opinion of such commander, the proper administration
of said act shall require it, to suspend or remove from office,
or from the performance of official duties, and the exercise of official
powers, any officer or person holding or exercising, or professing to
hold or exercise, any civil or military office or duty in such district,
under any power, election, appointment, or authority derived from,
or granted by, or claimed under, any so-called State, or the government
thereof, or any municipal or other division thereof; and upon
such suspension or removal such commander, subject to the approval
of the General as aforesaid, shall have power to provide from time to
time for the performance of the said duties of such officer or person
so suspended or removed, by the detail of some competent officer or
soldier of the army, or by the appointment of some other person to
perform the same, and to fill vacancies occasioned by death, resignation,
or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 3.</span> That the General of the army of the United States shall
be invested with all the powers of suspension, removal, appointment,
and detaching, granted in the preceding section to district commanders.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 4.</span> That the acts of the officers of the army, already done
in removing in said districts persons exercising the functions of civil
officers, and appointing others in their stead, are hereby confirmed;
provided that any persons heretofore or hereafter appointed by any
district commander to exercise the functions of any civil office may
be removed either by the military officer in command of the district,
or by the general of the army, and it shall be the duty of such commander
to remove from office, as aforesaid, all persons who are disloyal
to the government of the United States, or who use their official
influence in any manner to hinder, delay, prevent or obstruct the due
and proper administration of this act and the acts to which it is supplementary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 5.</span> That the boards of registration provided for in the act entitled
‘An Act supplementary to an Act entitled “An Act to provide
for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,” passed March
2, 1867, and to facilitate Restoration,” passed March 23, 1867, shall
have power, and it shall be their duty, before allowing the registration
of any person, to ascertain, upon such facts or information as
they can obtain, whether such person is entitled to be registered under
said act, and the oath required by said act shall not be conclusive
on such question; and no person shall be registered unless such
board shall decide that he is entitled thereto; and such board shall
also have power to examine under oath, to be administered by any
member of such board, any one touching the qualification of any person
claiming registration; but in every case of refusal by the board
to register an applicant, and in every case of striking his name from
the list, as hereinafter provided, the board shall make a note or
memorandum, which shall be returned with the registration list to the
commanding general of the district, setting forth the ground of such
refusal or such striking from the list: <em>Provided</em>, that no person shall
be disqualified as a member of any board of registration by reason
of race or color.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 6.</span> That the true intent and meaning of the oath presented
in said supplementary act is (among other things), that no person
who has been a member of the legislature of any State, or who has
held any executive or judicial office in any State, whether he has
taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States or
not, and whether he was holding such office at the commencement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>of the rebellion or had held it before, and who has afterwards engaged
in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given
aid or comfort to the enemies thereof, is entitled to be registered or
vote; and the words ‘executive or judicial’ office in any State, in
said oath mentioned, shall be construed to include all civil offices
created by law for the administration of any general law of a State,
or for the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 7.</span> That the time for completing the original registration
provided for in any act may, in the discretion of the commander of
any district, be extended to the 1st day of October, 1867; and the
board of registration shall have power, and it shall be their duty,
commencing fourteen days prior to any election under said act, and
upon reasonable public notice of the time and place thereof, to revise
for a period of five days the registration lists, and upon being satisfied
that any person not entitled thereto has been registered, to strike the
name of such person from the list, and such person shall not be allowed
to vote. And such board shall also, during the same period,
add to each registry the names of all persons who at that time possess
the qualifications required by said act, who have not been already
registered, and no person shall at any time be entitled to be
registered or to vote by reason of any executive pardon or amnesty,
for any act or thing which, without such pardon or amnesty, would
disqualify him from registration or voting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 8.</span> That all members of said boards of registration, and all
persons hereafter elected or appointed to office in said military districts
under any so-called State or municipal authority, or by detail
or appointment of the district commander, shall be required to take
and subscribe to the oath of office prescribed by law for the officers
of the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 9.</span> That no district commander or member of the board of
registration, or any officer or appointee acting under them, shall be
bound in his action by any opinion of any civil officer of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 10.</span> That section four of said last-named act shall be construed
to authorize the commanding general named therein, whenever
he shall deem it needful, to remove any member of a board of
registration, and to appoint another in his stead, and to fill any
vacancy in such board.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>“<span class='sc'>Sec. 11.</span> That all the provisions of this act, and of the acts to
which this is supplementary, shall be construed liberally, to the end
that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A bill was also passed appropriating $1,675,000 to carry
out the Reconstruction Acts, which was vetoed, and passed
over the veto; in the Senate by 32 to 4, and in the House by
100 to 24. The Senate passed a bill, 25 to 5, providing that
in the District of Columbia no person should be disqualified
for holding office on account of race or color. The President
sent in a communication, stating that the annual cost of maintaining
State Governments in the ten States was $14,000,000,
and if the General Government undertook to manage them it
would be greater; also that if it abolished the present State
Governments, it would be liable for their debts, amounting to
at least $100,000,000. The House passed a resolution, 100
to 18, declaring this communication “at war with the principles
of international law, a deliberate stab at the national
credit, abhorrent to every sentiment of loyalty, and well pleasing
only to the vanquished traitors by whose agency alone the
governments of said States were overthrown and destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the legislation on the subject of reconstruction
during the year 1867. We shall see in our next chapter
what was done by the military authorities and the people of
the desolated States, during the year, to carry out these measures.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a glance at the condition of these States early in the
year, we close our present chapter. The winter of 1866–67
was one of great and widely extended suffering. The crops
had been short, and of inferior quality, and for want of help
many of them had not been fully gathered. In some sections
there was actual starvation. Over $500,000 had been raised
in the Northern States and distributed mostly in breadstuffs
to those who were most in need. Congress, in March, authorized
the distribution of aid to a limited extent through the
Freedmen’s Bureau. In April, 65,000 persons received rations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>daily through the Freedmen’s Bureau, in Alabama alone,
and 20,000 more were on the verge of distress. There was
also prevalent a deplorable state of lawlessness. Bands of
armed men, ruffians, mostly bushwhackers, formerly connected
with the Rebel army, roamed through many districts,
plundering and burning property, and destroying the lives of
loyal men, white and black, often under circumstances of peculiar
atrocity. Some parts of the South, and especially Kentucky,
Middle and Western Tennessee, Louisiana, and Texas,
seemed given over to anarchy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of these States North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Louisiana, and Arkansas, and possibly some of the
other desolated States, will reverse their decision the present
summer, and Nebraska, Iowa, and Colorado will also vote
for it. On the other hand, New Jersey and Ohio, which
have now Democratic Legislatures, have attempted, but in
vain, to reverse their decisions and reject the Amendment.
The votes of the reconstructed States will undoubtedly be
sufficient to secure its adoption by the affirmative vote of
the constitutional number (three fourths) of the States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The commanders of the five military districts, Generals
Meade, Sickles, Pope, Thomas, and Sheridan, after the passage
of the Reconstruction Act, and its first supplement,
issued their orders, insisting on obedience to its provisions, as
according to the law they were required to do, but manifesting
at the same time a disposition to interfere as little as possible
with the existing civil government until the question of a constitutional
convention could be voted on, and if called, a new
constitution prepared and adopted, and the machinery of government
set in motion under the new regime. Many leading
citizens of the South, who had been prominent in the Rebellion,
advised acquiescence in the Congressional plan, and while
strong opposition was manifested in many quarters, it was
hoped that there would be a general participation in the work
of reorganization. The opposition was violent, and most
strongly marked in the cities, where many of the leading
papers, of Rebel antecedents, took an active part in abusing
and berating Congress. The action of the military commander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>of the <em>Fifth District</em>, General Sheridan, in suppressing
the violence of the Rebel opposition, was early and decided,
as, indeed, was necessary. On the 27th of March, 1867, he
removed from office Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General
of Louisiana, John T. Monroe, Mayor of New Orleans, and
Edmund Abell, Judge of the first District Court of the city,
and appointed in their places B. L. Lynch, Edward Heath,
and W. W. Howe. In a note to General Grant, soon after,
he assigned the following reasons for this action:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal
of these men, especially after the investigation made by the Military
Board on the massacre of July 30, 1866, and the report of the Congressional
Committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry
has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state
as follows: The court over which Judge Abell presided is the only
Criminal Court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at
least nine months previous to July 30, he had been educating a
large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage,
by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the
offenders, in case such an event occurred. The records of this court
will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty ones
has been prosecuted. In reference to Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General
of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict
these men before this criminal court. This he failed to do, but
went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole
nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters—in
other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.
He was, therefore, an abettor of and coadjutor with Judge Abell in
bringing on the massacre of July 30. Mayor Monroe controlled the
element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general
who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who
advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers
go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot
and massacre. With these three men exercising a large influence
on the worst elements of this city, giving to these elements an immunity
for riot and bloodshed, the General-in-chief will see how
insecure I felt in letting them occupy their present positions in the
troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>Monroe was mayor when New Orleans was captured by
Farragut and Butler. He had been pardoned by the President
and reëlected mayor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in April, General Griffin, who was in command in
Texas, wrote to General Sheridan, stating that, under the
Military Bill, both the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of
that State were disqualified to act, and that he desired the
immediate removal of Governor Throckmorton. General
Sheridan forwarded the letter to General Grant, with his
favorable recommendation indorsed thereon, and added that
he feared he would be compelled to remove Governor Wells,
of Louisiana, who was impeding him all he could. To this
General Grant responded, April 3, advising him not to remove
the governors at present, the question of the powers of
military commanders being under consideration in the Cabinet.
This ended the matter for the time being. On the 6th
of April, General Sheridan telegraphed General Grant that
he was nearly ready to proceed with the work of registration,
and that “an authoritative decision, as to what classes are disfranchised,
is very important.” General Grant replied, that
the questions had been submitted to the Attorney-General,
and that no answer had been received, adding, “Go on
giving your interpretation of the law until answer is given.”
Breaches in the Mississippi levees were very disastrous in
March and April, and there had been a serious conflict in
regard to Levee Commissioners. General Sheridan removed
those officers May 2, and appointed others in their places.
June 3, General Sheridan removed Governor Wells, and
appointed Thomas J. Durant in his stead. June 4, he informed
General Grant of his action, saying, “He has embarrassed
me very much since I came in command, by his
subterfuge and political chicanery. This necessary act will
be approved here by every class and shade of political opinion.
He has not a friend who is an honest man. Nothing will
answer here but a bold and strong course, and in taking it, I
am supported by every class and all parties.” Mr. Durant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>declining the office, General Sheridan, on the 6th, appointed
Benjamin F. Flanders in his stead. Governor Wells declining
to vacate the office, General Sheridan, on the 7th, addressed
a note to him, stating that he had been informed that he disputed
his right to remove him from office, which right he had
previously acknowledged and urged. He concluded his note
as follows: “I therefore send Brevet Brigadier-General
James W. Forsyth, of my staff, to notify you that he is sent
by me to eject you from the Governor’s room forcibly, unless
you consider this notification as equivalent to ejection.” General
Forsyth presented the communication on the 8th, when
Governor Wells vacated, responding, “I surrender the office
I hold only to the sword.” Governor Flanders went to New
Orleans in 1842, was driven out of the city in 1861, by a
body of Rebels, styling themselves a Vigilance Committee,
for his devotion to the Union. He made his way to Cairo
and Columbus, barely saving his life, and returned with
Butler in 1862. In the fall of the same year he was elected
a member of Congress. Upon his return, he was appointed
City Treasurer, and shortly afterward was selected, by Secretary
Chase, as supervising special agent for the Treasury
Department for the District. He was connected with the
Treasury Department from that time until his appointment
as Governor. It having been reported that General Grant
favored reprimanding Sheridan for the removal, the former
telegraphed the latter, June 7, denying the report, saying,
“There is not one word of truth in the story.” The bold
action of General Sheridan caused great excitement, and
rumors of his having been removed by the President were
constantly set afloat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Second District, Charleston was the scene of one or
two interesting incidents in the earlier days of the enforcement
of the Reconstruction Act. During the last ten days
in March, the freedmen, who had been denied equal privileges
in the cars, undertook to secure them by force, and several
of them were arrested. Commissioner R. K. Scott, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>Freedmen’s Bureau, issued a circular, warning them that
such attempts would only retard the acknowledgment of their
rights, and that their only remedy was through legal process.
The question was finally settled May 3, by the directors
resolving to admit all classes alike. The arrested persons
were released.</p>

<p class='c000'>An annual parade of the Charleston fire department was to
have taken place at ten o’clock on the morning of the 27th of
April. As it was about starting, it was observed that it did
not bear the American flag. General Sickles thereupon addressed
the chief engineer a note, stating that, at the previous
parade, regrets had been expressed at the absence of the
national emblem, and ordering that the Stars and Stripes be
borne at the head of the column; that an escort of honor be
detailed to escort it, and that each person in the procession
salute it. The order was obeyed, the procession being delayed
until the ensign was procured.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Sickles issued an order, April 10, known as General
Order No. 10, designed to relieve the destitute, which
attracted considerable attention. It prohibited imprisonment
for debt, except for fraud; directed that judgments on actions
arising during the Rebellion should not be enforced; sheriffs’
sales on process prior to December 19, 1860, were suspended
for a year; allowed process to continue judgments entered
since May 15, 1865; suspended all proceedings for the recovery
of money in the purchase of negroes; protected advances
of moneys and materials for agricultural purposes, and
made wages a lien; provided a homestead exemption of $500;
declared United States currency legal tenders; property of
an absent debtor should not be taken under foreign attachment,
but aliens should not be disturbed; other provisions
relative to criminal proceedings were set aside; the carrying
of deadly weapons was prohibited; corporeal punishment was
abrogated; the punishment of death in cases of burglary and
larceny was abolished, and terms of imprisonment substituted;
the governors of North and South Carolina were authorized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>to reprieve or pardon criminals sentenced by civil courts.
The order closed with these words: “Any law or ordinance
heretofore in force in North Carolina or South Carolina, inconsistent
with the provisions of this general order, are hereby
suspended and declared inoperative.” It gave great satisfaction
in South Carolina, on account of the features staying
executions in civil cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an opinion addressed to the President, June 12, Attorney-General
Stanbery strongly objected to the issuing of
this and other orders, which he said began to assume the dimensions
of a Code. He said that under it the commanding
general assumed, “not only a power to suspend the laws, but
to declare them generally inoperative, and assuming full
powers of legislation by the military authority.” The Attorney-General
proceeded: “The ground upon which these
extraordinary powers are based is thus set forth in military
order No. 1, issued in this district: ‘The civil government
now existing in North Carolina and South Carolina is provisional
only, and in all respects subject to the paramount authority
of the United States at any time to abolish, modify,
control, or supersede the same.’ Thus far the provisions of
the Act of Congress are well recited. What follows is in
these words: ‘Local laws and municipal regulations not inconsistent
with the Constitution and laws of the United
States, or the proclamations of the President, or with such
regulations as are or may be prescribed in the orders of the
commanding general, are hereby declared to be in force, and,
in conformity therewith, civil officers are hereby authorized to
continue the exercise of their proper functions, and will be
respected and obeyed by the inhabitants.’ This construction
of his powers under the act of Congress places military commanders
on the same footing as the Congress of the United
States. It assumes that ‘the paramount authority of the
United States at any time to abolish, modify, control, or supersede,’
is invested in him as fully as it is reserved to Congress.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>The Attorney-General conceded that the orders were issued
under an honest belief they were necessary or expedient, and
warranted by the act of Congress, but he protested against
the assumption of such powers, as full of evil and mischief.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Sickles issued an order, April 18, establishing a
Provost Court in the military post of Aiken, S. C., in consequence
of “it having become apparent that justice to freedmen
cannot be obtained in the civil courts within that post.”
The court was given jurisdiction of any case to which a person
of color was a party, except murder, arson, and rape. On
the 23d of April, he issued an order prohibiting the sale or
gift of liquors to United States soldiers, sailors, or marines,
and giving post commanders supervision over all sheriffs and
police within their commands, and directing them, “whenever
necessary for the preservation of order, and the efficient
discharge of their duties, to assume command of the police
force.” It having been alleged that the supply of food had
been greatly diminished by distillation; that distillers defrauded
the revenue, and maltreated the collectors when endeavoring
to collect the tax; and that the practice of distillation
tended to increase poverty, disorder, and crime, he issued
an order May 30, prohibiting the distillation of grain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The strictures of the Attorney-General were received in
Charleston June 19, and the same day General Sickles forwarded
a request to Washington to be relieved from duty,
and demanded a court of inquiry on his official actions. He
was subsequently relieved, but the court of inquiry was not
granted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Third District.</em>—Early in April, movements were instituted
in Washington to enjoin the enforcement of the Reconstruction
Act, in the name of the State of Georgia. (A similar
movement was made on the part of Mississippi). On the
10th of April, Governor Jenkins, of Georgia, issued an address
to the people of the State, dated at Washington, advising
them to take no action under the Reconstruction law until its
constitutionality could be tested. On the 24th, General Pope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>addressed him a note, reminding him that it was his duty,
under the law, to place no impediment in the way of reconstruction,
and that if he did, he was liable to removal. General
Pope likewise addressed General Grant on the subject.
His letter contained the following paragraph:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ill effects of permitting the whole power of the provisional
State government, through all its civil departments and in all its
ramifications, to be used to frustrate the acts of Congress, and to
keep up the disturbed condition of the public mind, cannot be overstated.
No reconstruction is possible, and it will be next to impossible
to secure faithful administration of the laws, while such influences
are allowed to go on unchecked, unless the entire civil
government is overthrown and the military substituted. I deem it
of the last importance to arrest it now, in the person of Provisional
Governor Jenkins. If he is permitted to set authority at defiance,
it will be useless to notice such offenses committed by the minor
officers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant forwarded the letter to the War Department,
indorsed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Respectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War for his information.
The telegraphic despatch herein inclosed shows that Governor
Jenkins, of Georgia, has given such pledges to the commander of
the Third District as to induce him to withhold, for the present, his
order suspending the Governor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The conduct of Governor Jenkins demonstrates, however, how
possible it is for discontented civil officers of the reconstructed States
to defeat the laws of Congress, if the power does not exist with the
district commanders to suspend their functions for cause in some
way. It seems clear to me that the power is given in the bill ‘for
the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,’ to use or not, at
the pleasure of district commanders, the provisional machinery set
up without the authority of Congress, in the States to which the
Reconstruction Act applies. There being doubt, however, on this
point, I would respectfully ask an early opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the power of removal does not exist with district commanders,
then it will become necessary for them to take refuge under that
section of the Bill which authorizes military commissions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>A riot occurred in Mobile, May 14, on the occasion of a
speech made by Judge Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who had
been speaking in the South in favor of reorganizing under
Congressional law. Four persons were killed and twenty
wounded. A citizens’ meeting was held, composed of all parties,
which denounced the outrage. The Mayor and Chief of
Police were censured, on an investigation into the affair, and,
on the 22d of May, were removed, and others appointed in
their stead.</p>

<p class='c000'>A negro riot took place in Richmond, May 9, on the occasion
of an engine trial, when a thousand negroes were dispersed
at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p class='c000'>No events worthy of special notice occurred in the First
and Fourth Districts, except the registration proceedings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Registration, and the Powers of Military Commanders.</em>—The
military commanders had scarcely begun the work of
registration before questions involving the construction of the
law were originated. Different commanders construed the
act differently, and of course conflicting instructions were
given. Some were very stringent, and others more moderate.
The one most widely variant from those generally issued, was
issued by General Ord, June 10. The views of Secretary
Stanbery and General Grant, respectively, are set forth in
the following note, signed by General Grant, June 23:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I entirely dissent from the views contained in Paragraph IV.
Your view as to the duty of registrars to register every man who
will take the required oath, though they know the applicant perjures
himself, is sustained by the views of the Attorney-General. My
opinion is, that it is the duty of the Board of Registration to see, so
far as it lies in their power, that no unauthorized person is allowed
to register. To secure this end, registrars should be allowed to
administer oaths and examine witnesses. The law, however, makes
district commanders their own interpreters of their power and duty
under it: and, in my opinion, the Attorney-General or myself can
no more than give our opinion as to the meaning of the law; neither
can enforce their views against the judgment of those made responsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>for the faithful execution of the law,—the district commanders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Attorney-General had addressed an opinion to the
President, May 24, giving his interpretation of the law, so far
as relates to registration, at length. Under it there were
comparatively few who were not entitled to register. This
opinion was forwarded to the various commanders by the
President, with a note, directing attention to it. General
Pope, June 27, telegraphed General Grant to learn whether
the note of the President was mandatory or not, and received
the following response:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enforce your own construction of the Military Bill until ordered
to do otherwise. The opinion of the Attorney-General has not
been distributed to district commanders in language or manner entitling
it to the force of an order, nor can I suppose that the President
intended it to have such force.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A similar despatch was sent to General Sheridan the same
day, in answer to a telegram. The latter officer, June 22,
wrote to General Grant, that the opinion of the Attorney-General
opened a “broad, macadamized road to perjury,” and
that its effects were beginning to show themselves in organized
opposition to all the acts of the military commanders. “Every
civil officer in the State will administer justice according to
his own views: many of them, denouncing the Military Bill
as unconstitutional, will throw every impediment in the way
of its execution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Attorney-General gave a lengthy opinion, June 12, to
the effect that military commanders did not possess the power
to remove State officers; that they could not take cognizance
of past offenses; and generally confining their powers within
limits more contracted than it had been supposed was the
scope of the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the supplementary Reconstruction Act of July 23,
the military commanders proceeded in the discharge of their
duties. General Sheridan, on the 30th of July, issued an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>order in these words: “A careful consideration of the reports
of Brevet Major-General Charles Griffin, U. S. A., shows
that J. W. Throckmorton, Governor of Texas, is an impediment
to the reconstruction of that State under the law. He
is, therefore, removed from that office. E. M. Pease is hereby
appointed Governor of Texas, in place of J. W. Throckmorton,
removed. He will be obeyed and respected accordingly.”
Governor Pease took the oath of office, August 7,
and Governor Throckmorton vacated the following day. On
the 3d of August, General Sheridan informed General Grant
that the work of registration in Louisiana was complete, and
that “the State will, in all probability, come in as a Union
State. In accomplishing this registration, I have had no opposition
from the masses of the people; on the contrary, much
assistance and encouragement; but from the public press,
especially that of the city of New Orleans, and from office-holders
and office-seekers disfranchised, I have met with bitterness
and opposition. I have, as I have heretofore stated to
you, permitted no political influence nor political machinery
to help or influence me in this work. Receiving the law as an
order, it was so executed. I regret that I have to make the
charge against Brigadier-General L. H. Rousseau, U. S. A.,
of visiting my command recently, and without exhibiting any
authority, interfering with my duties and suggesting my removal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>President Johnson had long been dissatisfied with Secretary
Stanton, who was friendly to the Congressional plan of reconstruction,
and had aided so far as was in his power, in the
faithful execution of the laws pertaining to that subject. The
President was desirous of having his Cabinet composed wholly
of men who would reflect his views and support him in the
violation or careless and incomplete execution of the measures
which he hated, and Stanton, whom he could not use or control,
was to him a Mordecai sitting in the king’s gate, who
would do him no reverence. He determined, therefore, to rid
himself of him. Accordingly, on the 5th of August, he addressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>a note to the Secretary, saying that public considerations
of high character constrained him to say that his resignation
as Secretary of War would be accepted. Secretary
Stanton replied the same day in the following terms: “In
reply, I have the honor to say, that public considerations of a
high character, which alone have induced me to continue at
the head of this department, constrain me not to resign the
office of Secretary of War before the next meeting of Congress.”
To this, the President made no direct reply. But
his determination to drive Stanton from the War Department
had been too long cherished to be relinquished, especially by
a man of such a tenacious and wilful disposition as the President.
He had intimated in the latter part of July, to General
Grant, his intention of removing both Secretary Stanton and
General Sheridan, the commander of the Fifth District, from
their positions, and the General-in-chief, who well knew the
value of the two men, in executing promptly and fairly the
laws, had remonstrated in the following manly letter, which
was only made public on the subsequent demand of Congress:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“1. On the subject of the displacement of the Secretary of War.
His removal cannot be effected against his will without the consent
of the Senate. It is but a short time since the United States Senate
was in session, and why not then have asked for his removal, if it
was desired? It certainly was the intention of the legislative branch
of the Government to place the Cabinet Ministers beyond the power
of Executive removal, and it is pretty well understood that, so far as
Cabinet Ministers are affected by the Tenure of Office Bill, it was
intended especially to protect the Secretary of War, whom the
country felt great confidence in. The meaning of the law may
be explained away by an astute lawyer, but common sense and
the views of loyal people will give to it the effect intended by its
framers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>“2. On the subject of the removal of the very able commander of
the Fifth Military District, let me ask you to consider the effect it
would have upon the public. He is unusually and deservedly beloved
by the people who sustained this Government through its trials,
and feared by those who would still be enemies of the Government.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It fell to the lot of but few men to do as much against our armed
enemy as General Sheridan did during the Rebellion; and it is
within the scope of the ability of few, in this or other countries, to
do what he has. His civil administration has given equal satisfaction.
He has had difficulties to contend with which no other district
commander has encountered. Almost, if not quite, from the
day he was appointed district commander to the present time, the
press has given out that he was to be removed; that the administration
was dissatisfied with him, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This has emboldened the opponents to the laws of Congress
within his command to oppose him in every way in their power, and
has rendered necessary, measures which otherwise might never have
been necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In conclusion, allow me to say, as a friend desiring peace and
quiet, the welfare of the whole country, North and South, that it is,
in my opinion, more than the loyal people of this country (I mean
those who supported the Government during the great Rebellion)
will quietly submit to, to see the very men of all others whom they
have expressed confidence in, removed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would not have taken the liberty of addressing the Executive
of the United States thus, but for the conversation on the subject
alluded to in this letter, and from a sense of duty, feeling that I
know I am right in this matter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The President was not, as we have said, to be turned from
his purpose. On the 12th of August, he notified Secretary
Stanton that he was suspended from office from that date,
and on the same day addressed a note to General Grant authorizing
and requiring him to act as Secretary of War <em>ad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>interim</em>. General Grant informed Secretary Stanton of his
assignment and acceptance, assuring him at the same time of
his appreciation of the zeal, patriotism, firmness, and ability
with which he had ever discharged his duties as Secretary of
War. Mr. Stanton replied to both the President and the
General; denying the power of the former to suspend him
from office, without the consent of the Senate, and saying that
he yielded under protest to superior force; and repeating the
protest to the latter, while at the same time he assured him
of his personal appreciation of his sentiments and patriotism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus, for the time (though not permanently, as he
hoped), disposed of Secretary Stanton, Mr. Johnson next
proceeded to issue an order, assigning General George H.
Thomas to the command of the Fifth District, General Hancock
to the Department of the Cumberland, and General
Sheridan to the Department of Missouri, and directing the
Secretary of War <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span></i> to issue the necessary instructions
to carry the order into effect. A note from the President
accompanied the order, that, before he issued the
instructions, he would be pleased to receive any suggestions
respecting the assignments. General Grant replied the same
day in a note, from which the following is an extract:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am pleased to avail myself of this invitation to urge, earnestly
urge—urge in the name of a patriotic people, who have sacrificed
hundreds of thousands of loyal lives, and thousands of millions of
treasure, to preserve the integrity and union of this country—that
this order be not insisted on. It is unmistakably the expressed wish
of the country that General Sheridan should not be removed from
his present command. This is a Republic, where the will of the
people is the law of the land. I beg that their voice may be
heard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“General Sheridan has performed his civil duties faithfully and
intelligently. His removal will only be regarded as an effort to defeat
the laws of Congress. It will be interpreted by the unreconstructed
element in the South—those who did all they could to
break up this Government by arms, and now wish to be the only
element consulted as to the method of restoring order—as a triumph.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>It will embolden them to renewed opposition to the will of the loyal
masses, believing that they have the Executive with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are military reasons, pecuniary reasons, and, above all,
patriotic reasons, why this order should not be insisted on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg to refer to a letter, marked private,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> which I wrote to the
President when first consulted on the subject of the change in the
War Department. It bears upon the subject of this removal, and I
had hoped would have prevented it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The President responded in a lengthy letter, dated the
19th. He had not intended to invite a formal report, but
only a verbal statement of General Grant’s views. He was
not aware that this question of removal of General Sheridan
had been submitted to the people for their determination.
He commended General Thomas’s abilities, and complained of
the results of General Sheridan’s administration as producing
a bitter spirit of antagonism. He had rendered himself exceedingly
obnoxious, and his rule had been one of absolute
tyranny. In his opinion, he should be removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant issued the instructions required, August
19, attaching a clause, directing General Thomas to “continue
to execute all orders he may find in force in the Fifth
Military District at the time of his assuming command of it,
unless authorized by the General of the Army to annul, alter,
or modify them.” In consequence of the unfavorable condition
of General Thomas’s health, the President issued an order,
August 26, assigning General Hancock to the Fifth District,
directing him to “proceed directly to New Orleans,
Louisiana, and, assuming the command to which he is hereby
assigned, he will, when necessary to a faithful execution of the
laws, exercise any and all powers conferred by acts of Congress
upon district commanders, and all authority pertaining
to officers in command of military departments.” General
Grant issued the necessary instructions. General Sheridan
was directed to turn over his command to Major-General
Charles Griffin, which he at once proceeded to do. He then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>came North, visited many of the principal cities, in all of which
he was enthusiastically received. General Griffin assumed
command, September 7, and issued an order, in which he
directed that “all existing orders should remain in full.”
General Griffin soon died, of yellow fever, and Brevet Major-General
Joseph A. Mower assuming command, reiterated the
same order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President issued an order, August 26, relieving Major-General
Daniel E. Sickles, and assigning Brevet Major-General
Edward R. S. Canby to the command, of the Second
District. General Canby assumed command, September 5,
and in his order adopted and confirmed all existing orders and
regulations.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Canby issued an order, September 14, declaring
tax-payers registered as voters, qualified to serve as jurors.
General Mower issued an order, September 28, declaring all
persons registered in Texas qualified to act as jurymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant issued an order, August 29, as General of
the Army, directing that commanders of the military districts
created under the Act of March 2, 1867, should make no appointments
to civil office of persons who have been removed,
by themselves or their predecessors in command.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 3d of September, apparently in vindication of his previous
acts, President Johnson issued a proclamation declaring
the supremacy of the Constitution, the Laws, and the decisions
of the Civil Courts, warning all persons against obstructing
them, and enjoining all civil and military officers to enforce
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th of September, 1867, the President issued
another amnesty proclamation, in which he declared the people
of the unreconstructed States loyally disposed, deprecated
a vindictive policy, and extended the benefits of the Amnesty
Proclamation of May 29, 1865, to all persons except the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.</em> The chief, or pretended chief executive officers, including
the President, Vice-President, and all heads of departments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>of the pretended Confederate or Rebel Government, and
all who were agents thereof in foreign states and countries, and
all who held, or pretended to hold, in the service of the said
pretended Confederate Government, a military rank or title
above the grade of Brigadier-General, or naval rank or title
above that of Captain, and all who were, or pretended to be,
governors of States while maintaining, abetting, submitting
to, or acquiescing in, the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.</em> All persons who, in any way, treated otherwise
than as lawful prisoners of war, persons who, in any capacity,
were employed or engaged in the military or naval service of
the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Third.</em> All persons who, at the time they may seek to obtain
the benefits of this proclamation, are actually in civil, military,
or naval confinement or custody, or legally held to bail
either before or after conviction; and all persons who were engaged
directly or indirectly in the assassination of the late President
of the United States, or in any plot or conspiracy in any
manner therewith connected.</p>

<p class='c000'>This proclamation further declared the amnestied persons
restored to all privileges, immunities, and rights of property,
except as to property with regard to slaves, and except in
cases of legal proceedings under the laws of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>This proclamation amnestied a very large number of Rebels,
and left very few to be excepted from pardon, and the greater
part of these received special pardons from the President
upon application, without any professions of repentance being
required. Other cases also received the Executive clemency,
greatly to the prejudice of all efforts to bring offenders to justice.
Every counterfeiter or forger of the national currency or bonds,
every man who had defrauded the Government during the war,
by means of spurious claims, and every one who was detected
in the attempt to cheat the Government of its dues in the way
of internal revenue, was promptly pardoned by the Executive,
generally on the first application.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Hancock assumed command of the Fifth Military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>District on the 29th of November, 1867, and issued a special
order on taking command, of which the second item was the
most important, as containing an exposition of his intentions
in regard to the military and civil government of the district.
It was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Second.</em> The General commanding is gratified to learn that peace
and quiet reign in this department. It will be his purpose to preserve
this condition of things. As a means to this great end, he regards
the maintenance of the civil authorities in the faithful execution
of the laws, as the most efficient under existing circumstances. In
war it is indispensable to repel force by force, and overthrow and destroy
opposition to authority; but when insurrectionary force has been
overthrown and peace established, and the civil authorities are ready
and willing to perform their duties, the military power should cease
to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful
dominion. Solemnly impressed with these views, the General announces
that the great principles of American liberty still are the
lawful inheritance of this people, and ever should be. The right of
trial by jury, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, the liberty of the press, the freedom
of speech, and the natural rights of persons and the rights of property
must be preserved. Free institutions, while they are essential
to the prosperity and happiness of the people, always furnish the
strongest inducements to peace and order. Crimes and offenses
committed in the district must be referred to the consideration and
judgment of the regular civil authorities, and these tribunals will be
supported in their lawful jurisdiction. Should there be violations of
existing laws, which are not inquired into by the civil magistrates,
or should failures in the administration of justice by the courts be
complained of, the cases will be reported to these Head-quarters,
when such orders will be made as may be deemed necessary. While
the General thus indicates his purpose to respect the liberties of the
people, he wishes all to understand that armed insurrections or forcible
resistance to law, will be instantly suppressed by arms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>President Johnson had at last, after much tribulation, found
a district commander after his own heart; and though it was
soon found that General Hancock removed loyal men from
office, and, so far as he could, put disloyal ones in their place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>and that he was winning the praise of every rebel in his district
and the hearty dislike of every loyal citizen, yet the
President was so delighted with his course and his proclamations,
that on the 18th of December, 1867, he sent a message
to Congress, in which, after the most fulsome commendation
of the General, comparing him to Washington, and saying
that to him belonged the distinguished honor of being the first
officer in high command south of the Potomac, since the close
of the civil war, who had given utterance to these noble sentiments
in the form of a military order, he suggested to Congress,
that some public recognition of General Hancock’s patriotic
conduct was due, if not to him, to the friends of law and
justice throughout the country. “Of such an act as his at
such a time,” he continued, “it is best fitting that the dignity
should be vindicated and the virtue proclaimed, so that its
value as an example may not be lost to the nation.” Congress
could not view General Hancock’s conduct in so praiseworthy
a light, and they accordingly declined to make any
public recognition of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>On assuming command, General Hancock found in force an
order issued by General Mower, who had been in temporary
command, dated November 21, removing several State and
other officers. These orders were revoked in different orders,
and on the 3d of December, General Mower was relieved
from duty as Commander of the District of Louisiana and
Commissioner of Freedmen, and returned to his regiment.
General Hancock also issued an order, December 5, revoking
an order issued August 24, requiring persons to be sworn for
registered voters, and restoring the State laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>An order was issued from the Freedmen’s Bureau for the
District of Louisiana, December 19, which provided that all
differences between whites and freedmen, or between freedmen
themselves, should first be referred to the civil courts for
adjudication. The Bureau agents were to seek, in the first
place, an amicable adjustment of difficulties, but if they failed
in that, then resort was to be had to the courts, to which, also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>all legal questions must be referred. They were likewise to
act on behalf of the freedmen as attorneys, and in case planters
refuse or neglect to pay their wages, if the courts fail
to award justice, then the agents are to enforce it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, General Hancock proceeded to remove the
colored members of the Council of Education in New Orleans,
on the alleged ground that they had transcended their powers
and duties, and to put Rebels in their places. General Grant,
on investigation, ordered him to reinstate the members he had
removed. He complied with the order, but requested to be
relieved from his command, and after some delay his request
was granted, and the President created a new Military Department
of Washington, including Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania,
and the District of Columbia, and after trying several
other officers, placed Major-General Hancock in command of
it. Meantime, the voting for the constitutional conventions,
under the Reconstruction Act, had resulted in the decision to
hold conventions in all the desolated States, and the conventions
had begun to assemble. The first to convene was that
of Alabama, November 5. It consisted of one hundred delegates,
sixty-one of whom signed the new Constitution, and
sixteen protested against it. Its provisions were substantially
the same with those of the other States, which followed in its
train, and we therefore quote them as examples of the general
character of these constitutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>It declared all men created equal; persons born in the
United States or naturalized, to be citizens of the State of
Alabama, possessing equal civil and political rights and public
privileges, and prohibiting slavery. The following is the
article in regard to suffrage:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“In all elections by the people, the electors shall vote by ballot.
Every male person born in the United States, and every person who
has been naturalized, or who has legally declared his intentions to
become a citizen of the United States, twenty-one years old or upwards,
who shall have resided in this State six months next preceding
the election, and three months in the county in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>offers to vote, except as hereinafter provided, shall be deemed an
elector.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soldiers, sailors, and marines in the United States service are not
permitted to vote by reason of being stationed in the State on duty.
Registration must be provided for by the General Assembly, and
the following persons are not permitted to register.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>First.</em> Those who during the late Rebellion inflicted or caused to
be inflicted any cruel or unusual punishment upon any soldier, sailor,
or marine, employee, or citizen of the United States, or who in any
other way violated the rules of civilized warfare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Second.</em> Those who may be disqualified from holding office by
the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
known as Article XIV., and those who have been disqualified from
registering to vote for delegates to the Convention to frame a Constitution
for the State of Alabama, under the act of Congress ‘to
provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States,’
passed by Congress March 2, 1867, and the acts supplementary
thereto, except such persons as aided in the reconstruction proposed
by Congress, and accept the political equality of all men before the
law: <em>Provided</em>, That the General Assembly shall have power to remove
the disabilities incurred under this clause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Third.</em> Those who shall have been convicted of treason, embezzlement
of public funds, malfeasance in office, crime punishable by
law with imprisonment in the penitentiary, or bribery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Fourth.</em> Those who are idiots or insane.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All persons, before registering, must take and subscribe the following
oath: ‘I, ——, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support
and maintain the Constitution and laws of the United States,
and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama; that I am
not excluded from registering by any of the clauses in section 8, article
7, of the Constitution of the State of Alabama; that I will never
countenance or aid in the secession of this State from the United
States; that I accept the civil and political equality of all men, and
agree not to attempt to deprive any person or persons, on account of
race, color, or previous condition, of any political or civil right, privilege,
or immunity, enjoyed by any other class of men; and furthermore,
that I will not in any way injure, or countenance in others
any attempt to injure, any person or persons, on account of past or
present support of the Government of the United States, the laws of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>the United States, or the principle of the political and civil equality
of all men, or for affiliation with any political party.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Convention adjourned December 6, and the Constitution
was submitted to the people on the 4th and 5th of February,
1868. The Rebels and those opposed to the Constitution, and
to the Congressional policy of reconstruction, used every device
to defeat it. The provisions of the Reconstruction Act required
that for the adoption of the Constitution, there must be a majority
of the whole number of registered voters, and taking advantage
of this, the Rebels registered as many names as possible
(many, it was believed, fraudulently), and then, when the time
came for voting, they not only kept away from the polls themselves,
but by threats, by discharging from their employ every
colored man who would vote, and by a general system of terrorism,
sought to prevent as many as possible from voting.
The registration was 170,631 voters, but the registry of four
counties was illegal and fraudulent. This reduced the whole
number of registered voters to 156,945; and the lowest number
required for ratification of the Constitution was 78,473.
The actual legal vote, under these adverse influences, was
70,359, or 8,114 short of the vote required. Of these 70,359
votes, 62,089 were for the Constitution. Under the existing
law, therefore, the Constitution failed of ratification.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Louisiana Convention met November 23. It adopted
for its first article, that all men were born free and equal, and
on the 28th of December, enacted the following as its second
article: “All persons, without regard to race, color, or previous
condition, born and naturalized in the United States,
and residents of this State for one year, are citizens of this
State. They shall enjoy the same civil, political, and public
rights and privileges, and be subject to the same pains and
penalties.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This Constitution was voted upon in April, and was ratified
by a majority of over 17,000 votes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Georgia Convention met on the 12th of December,
and sat through nearly the whole of January. The Constitution
formed by it was adopted in April, by about 18,000
majority.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span>The Florida Convention met January 20, 1868. At first
there was considerable difficulty—two factions existing in the
Convention, which seemed determined to divide and ruin its
councils; but through the friendly interference of General
Meade, who had succeeded to General Pope in command of
the district on the 28th of December, 1867, the two parties
were reconciled, and the Convention perfected its Constitution,
which was ratified by the people early in May, by about 3,000
majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>In South Carolina the Convention was called by a large
majority, and met on —— ——. Its Constitution was ratified
in April, by a majority of over 36,000, in a registry of
127,550, and a vote of 85,843.</p>

<p class='c000'>North Carolina adopted her new Constitution also in April,
by nearly 30,000 majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arkansas voted on her new Constitution in May, and ratified
it by about 2,000 majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas have each held their conventions
and framed constitutions, but they have not yet been
submitted to the people.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>While the desolated States were thus striving to get into
line, and henceforth keep step to the music of loyalty and
Union, and, despite the bitter and ingenious opposition of the
disloyal and rebellious portion of the population, and the
hostility of President Johnson, were meeting with remarkable
success, their social condition had, as yet, improved very
little. The winter of 1867–68 was one of extensive suffering,
especially among the freedmen and the poor whites, from
several causes: The crops of the year 1867 had been, for the
most part, poor; there had not been a sufficiency of corn or
other grain grown in the South for the consumption of the
population, and where cotton, sugar, and rice were cultivated,
in a majority of cases the crop had not been sufficient
to pay the expense incurred by the still thriftless managers,
and, as somebody must suffer, they preferred that it should
be the freedmen, whom they drove away, without pay, in the
depth of winter, alleging that the advances already made to
them covered, or more than covered, their entire earnings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>In most of the States the freedmen were not, as yet, permitted
to either hire or buy land. Where they could do so,
and could in any way procure the means of cultivating it,
they were industrious and economical, and managed to live
comfortably.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the measures to which the Rebel planters resorted,
most generally, to prevent, if possible, the calling of a constitutional
convention, or later, the adoption of a constitution,
was to discharge, at once, all in their employ who should
dare to vote for either. Their papers openly advocated this
outrageous despotism, and their advice was followed very
widely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under these circumstances, it was certainly remarkable
that no larger number of the colored people fell into a condition
of dependence and pauperism, and that, ignorant as
most of them were, and, as yet, indisposed to extra exertion
from the life-long enervating influence of slavery, with the
old fear of the lash still lingering in their minds, they should
have braved all the threats and persecution of their old
masters, and dared to contend so earnestly for their rights.</p>

<p class='c000'>The polls, in these States, both at the time of voting for the
Convention and for the Constitution, presented scenes of
mingled pathos and humor, which could not fail to impress
deeply every thoughtful mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondent of the “Cincinnati Commercial,” himself
somewhat inclined to sympathize with the President’s
policy, was at Montgomery, Alabama, when the vote was
taken on the adoption of the new Constitution, and his
account of what he witnessed is so graphic, and tallies so
exactly with what was observed in other States, that we
cannot do better than to reproduce a portion of it:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The influences brought to bear to induce them to coöperate with
the late master class have been ingenious and manifold. If good-humoredly
reasoned with, they would only nod in reply. Scolding
fell on their impassive heads as uselessly as a spitball. Expostulation
was of no avail. Threats of proscription have been less fruitless,
but many thousands disregarded every motive save the one that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>spurred them to vote for the political elevation of their race. It is
universally asserted by the Conservatives, that the poor negroes are
the dupes of designing white ‘carpet-baggers,’ who desire to be
floated into office and emolument. That such designing persons
exist is not to be doubted, but the black man, at this election, is
trying to pull out of the fire the largest and most succulent chestnuts
for himself and his own people. Read the proposed Constitution,
and judge for yourself if he be snapping for more shadow than
substance. Though often credulous, and by nature always confiding,
he has a just apprehension of the stake played for in this deal of
the political cards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For four days the election has been quietly proceeding. To-day
is the last of the term allowed. If ratification fail, it will not be
because time enough was not given to muster all who desired to
vote. Originally but two days were named, then four. The voting
commenced in a raw rain-storm, the creeks became swollen, and it
was feared that many negroes would be kept at home by the
wretched weather and roads. So another day was added by General
Meade, making five in all. The first two days were exceedingly
chilly, wet, and gloomy. The second two were mild and
sunny. To-day promises to be a lovely one. But, rain or shine,
the streets of Montgomery have been thronged with negroes. The
curbstone restaurants (ranging in size from a hand-basket to a
rickety table) have continued operations on a scale adapted to the
crisis. Ebony cobblers on back streets have been pegging away,
day and night, at the shocking bad foot-gear of tramping voters
from distant plantations. Wooden awnings have sheltered a nightly
bivouac. Every hospitable hut has lodged enough darkies to give
it a double claim to be called a black hole. The warm sides of the
avenues have had their ebony procession lengthened and widened to
the election standard; and philanthropic auctioneers have about
closed out their stock of goods and stock of conscience, at a fearful
sacrifice, of course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the reader now will come with me, and watch for a while how
the voting proceeds, I promise him a novel experience. We will not
take the first day of the voting, for then it was painful to see the
crowd of ragged colored men standing for hours in the pitiless
storm, waiting to slip in their tickets, and so fearful of losing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>turns, that one who had deposited his vote found no avenue of
egress, save that paved with the heads of those behind. Let us
choose the third day, for the air is bland and the sky cloudless.
There stand the black pilgrims, you see, ranged (for better order
prevails to-day) in a double queue. At the side of the window,
where the vote is handed in, are two policemen—one to admit the
voter, the other to point the way out. In front of the window is
the Conservative challenging committee of four. One of the four
keeps tally of the vote; another scans the registration list as the
name of each voter is announced; the third writes down the names
not found registered, and the fourth makes himself generally watchful.
Behind the window three judges are seated around a table,
bearing in its centre a large pine ballot-box.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The column of negroes waiting to vote is jammed together as if
by some uncontrollable muscular impulse, but it surges back whenever
the barrier of the first policeman threatens to give way. They
do not talk to each other, deeming silence, perhaps, to be due to the
sacred importance of the occasion. If their eye catches yours (you
are a Caucasian, remember), it falls with an expression of embarrassment,
as if they felt that you, being white, looked with keen
disfavor on the act they had drawn up to perform. Falstaff’s recruits
were not greater ragamuffins. Look at the garb of these
negroes, and I defy you to point out one unpatched garment in fifty.
Gray coats and blue coats, worn out three years ago, still are forced
to serve in a tattered sartorial invalid corps. One coat (doubtless
for Sunday and elections) is made of cheap ingrain carpeting. The
pantaloons are more shred-like than the coats; the hats advanced to
all degrees of organic decay. Not one in twenty wears boots, and
few shoes retain much of their original homely integrity. In shape,
they might inclose either a small ham, or the foot of any human
being deformed by toil among the clods of cotton-fields. If you
study the heads and the faces, you will find more indications of a
gentle, submissive, ease-loving heart, than of active intelligence or
ambitious disposition.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whatever the natural aptitudes of the African may be, a hundred
years of slavery in Alabama have not added anything attractive
to his phrenological development. That many of them are very
ignorant of the scope and meaning of citizenship, is as plain as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>their determination to learn more about it. The hunger to have
the same chances as the white man, they feel and comprehend as
clearly as they understand a physical craving. That is what brings
them here, and not the expectation of getting free lands, free rations,
and free mules. Your Conservative friend may tell you that
they look for such windfalls; but talk to as many on the subject as
I have, and you will accumulate the strongest sort of rebutting evidence.
The last one I sounded looked at me with a shade of rebuke,
and said: ‘No, sah. I spect to git nuffin but what I works
hard for, and when I’se sick I’ll get docked.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enter the first voter. He takes off his hat, and nervously
gives his name to the judges. They run over the registration list.
So do the Conservative challengers, who, as you see, are afforded
every facility to contest and analyze. If the negro has a smooth
face they demand that he swear to his age, and he is accordingly
sworn. If his name be found, the judges announce the column in
which it stands, and the challengers check it off. In vain the voter,
seeing his vote glide into the box, and making his own way out,
strives to choke down the delight that fills him. If ever you saw
an amateur gamester win a heavy stake (which I trust you never
have unless it was at charming Baden-Baden, or some place in New
York where they go with a clergyman to study vice the better to
preach against it—ahem), you watched the same sort of a smile
on his face, as on the homely countenance of this happy freedman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enter the second. This middle-aged negro deliberately takes
off his mittens, removes his hat, runs one hand under his vest, produces
a little package, unwraps the rag around it, and at last hands
in the paper treasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Oh, the devil! be quick,’ says the Judge, rapping irately on
the window. ‘Put on your hat, uncle—that humility’s played
out,’ says one of the challengers, with a laugh. But the voter has
his own views as to the hat. Perhaps he stands uncovered to the
ballot and not to men. His ticket drops into the box, and he
stumps off, irradiated. The third! ‘Another George Washington.’
Another vote, too, and another chuckle. The fourth! The name
of this one cannot be found. ‘Go to head-quarters of registration,’
says the Judge; ‘if your name is there, they will give you a certificate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>enabling you to vote.’ ‘I’ve been thar,’ sorrowfully rejoins the
applicant. ‘’Taint thar.’ ‘Sorry,’ says the Judge; ‘make room,
make room.’ Now I ask you to watch this poor fellow. He comes
out looking sick at heart. A bright mulatto takes him aside, and
inquires into his case. It is hopeless—name not registered at all.
The disappointed darkey wanders around for ten minutes, then he
quietly falls again into the rear of the line, to be repulsed again and
again when he reaches the window. Hope that his name may have
been overlooked dies out at last, and not without the sharpest pang
his simple, but emotional nature can feel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enter the fifth. ‘My name is Henry Clay.’ ‘All right, Henry,
you can vote; you’re registered. But, Henry, where were you
born?’ ‘In Kentucky, sir; Henry Clay, of Ashland, was my
father.’ And the tall, handsome mulatto, bows and makes his way
out. The sixth! This is another of the persevering kind. He
gives his name. ‘Be off,’ says the Judge. ‘You have been here
already half a dozen times. You say you are not registered.’
‘Well, sah,’ replies the sorrowful negro, ‘I’se been hyah evah since
Tuesday trying to vote at one place or nuther, and I hasn’t had a
bite to eat, and I can’t vote, and I’se got to walk twelve miles to git
home.’ The red-nosed, cross-looking Judge takes a biscuit from his
pocket and hands it to the negro, with ‘Here, make room, now.’
One of the challengers says: ‘Boys, the Conservatives have the
name of being generous. Let’s give this hungry nigger a dinner.’
The speaker draws his pocket-book and transfers some currency to
the object of this kindly impulse, who takes it with a ‘tankee,’ but
a vacant look. It is a vote he wants, not a meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So the strange procession moves slowly on. If you wish to
determine how much the negro’s heart is in this election, watch his
face as he comes away from that little window. His vote once in,
every feature blazes with joy; but his vote rejected, sorrow and
dismay are expressed even in his attitudes. Watch the anxious but
resolute sooty faces in those waiting their turns. Is all this emotion
due to the duplicity of Yankee adventurers? Can the ‘carpet-bagger’
thus sway the very soul of the black man to reach his own selfish
ends? Is it for a possible mule and forty acres of land that the
negro is thus profoundly stirred; that he braves hardship, the ill-will
of his employers, and, may be, starvation itself? No, friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>Conservative. The slave you once owned, ignorant as he is still,
and lowly in social rank, feels, as he casts that ballot, the throes
that liberty awakened, and which, unchecked by renewed oppression,
will give his manhood a rapid and generous growth. I do not
seek to conceal his ignorance about the technical duties of citizenship.
An old black fellow came, as I stood near one of the polls,
and proffered me his vote, asking: ‘Are you de boss?’ The question
is, Does the lack of such technical knowledge unfit him for
useful and honest citizenship? There have been periods in the
history of our country when a loyal heart, an honest, incorruptible
nature, were worth more than ten thousand of the most choicely
cultivated intellects on the national roll of the rich, the powerful,
and the gifted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The question has been often asked, and sometimes in a
tone of triumph, as if it were unanswerable, Is it not tyrannical,
on the part of the majority in Congress, to insist on
giving the ballot to the negro in the desolated States, when
the party which they represent refuses to permit the negro to
vote in the Northern States? Is it not a positive violation of
the golden rule—a placing of burdens upon the South which
they themselves will not bear?</p>

<p class='c000'>We answer both inquiries with a decided negative. Without
stopping to discuss the question of negro suffrage at the
North, farther than to say, that a large majority of the Republican
party throughout the North are in favor of it, and
have carried it in some of the States, and have been defeated
in others only by the coalition of Democrats and weak-kneed
Republicans, we take the ground that the condition of the
two sections is entirely different. At the North the negro
citizens had no special claims on us; they had manifested an
interest in the war, and some of them had volunteered to serve
in the ranks against the South, though hardly so many in proportion
to their number as the whites. We should prefer to
have them vote, for we do not believe in taxation without
representation; but, at the South, the negroes had been our
friends throughout the war; they had been steadily and persistently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>loyal, when very few of the whites were so, and
many thousands of them had laid down their lives for the
national cause. We had emancipated them, both as a military
necessity, and as an act of justice to an oppressed race.
But the close of the war, and the reinstating of their former
disloyal masters in power, as was done often by the pardons
of the President, left them like sheep in the midst of
wolves. Their old masters hated them for their loyalty, and
proceeded at once, under Mr. Johnson’s provisional governments,
to oppress them, to refuse them land, education, or
employment, except at wages which would not sustain life,
and to endeavor to reduce them back to slavery.</p>

<p class='c000'>To obviate this gross injustice, and to protect these wards
of the nation, to whom its honor was solemnly pledged, it
was necessary that they should be permitted to share in the
government, that loyalty might, at least, have equal rights
with disloyalty, the oppressed an equal voice with the oppressor.
This must be done, or the other alternative adopted,—that
of arming the negro and bringing on a war of races,
which would not have ceased till those States should have,
indeed, become desolate and without inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Congress had no ambition to reënact the bloody scenes of
St. Domingo, and they felt that with the kindly and placable
nature of the African, peace, quiet, and good order would be
sooner secured by giving him the ballot than in any other
way, and the event is even now demonstrating the wisdom of
their decision.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same able writer from whom we have already quoted,
after spending some months in the South, says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The freedmen have surprised me by their native shrewdness and
good sense, their cautious and submissive behavior, and the keen, intelligent
interest they take in their new political privileges. If they
were one tenth as vindictive and contemptuous in their manner
toward the whites as the whites toward them, a war of races would
have ensued long ago. From close observation, I believe them to
be humbler in deportment than before emancipation. As a class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>they are anxious to work and get on in the world. They are more
industrious than their late masters. And though the word has been
abused, they are as loyal to the government as it is possible for men
of their capacities to be. They would respond to a national summons
to arms with alacrity and enthusiasm. By their votes in their
conventions they have shown that they feel no hatred toward their
old oppressors, and ask nothing beyond security for the future.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scratch a Southerner, and you find an intolerant. He is not
willing to have you vote as your conscience dictates. Defy his
local despotisms, and you will be socially ostracized; your name will
be published in a black-list; you will be sneered at and insulted.
If you are a Northern man, acquire citizenship by the legal period
of residence, and get nominated to office, you will be ridiculed as a
Yankee adventurer—a ‘carpet-bagger.’ Witness the Alabama
election in February: witness the Southern newspaper treatment
of all the constitutional conventions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about Southern loyalty?</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>About three fourths of the Southern white people are passively disloyal.</em>
Could it be otherwise? For four years they rained death
on the National flag and the National uniform. They shot at and
cursed them. In every church in the Confederacy they prayed and
supplicated with fervor and with tears, to have them go down in disgrace.
Can it be that their gorge does not rise now at their sight?</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the boat coming up the Potomac from Aquia Creek, I heard
a Southerner confess that though he tried to subdue the emotion, he
still felt a hatred of the Stars and Stripes. He had fought under
Lee from first to last, and during that time had seen the flag so often
in battle when the army of the Potomac swept down upon him and
his companions in arms, that he feared he would never again be
able to look upon it as his flag.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The dominant class in the South never was republican in traits,
tastes, or habits. The revolution now going on in its industries and
system of labor tend to make it so, but as long as this generation
lives the change cannot be complete. The Southern man and woman
still deem themselves a better order of beings than the Yankees.
They will die in that faith. The vanity is ingrain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have been astonished to find how generally the Southerners believe
the North to be on the verge of civil convulsion. Reading only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>their own newspapers and the most violent Copperhead journals in
the North, they are firmly convinced that nothing is more likely to
happen than the embroilment of the Western with the Middle and
New England States. This delusion is shared by thousands of the
most intelligent men in the South. That they would delight in such
a calamity is as certain as the fact that the next gale that sweeps
from the North will not take to them ‘the clash of resounding arms.’
They cannot understand the elastic temper and wholesome tolerance
of the North, where elections come and go, crises ripen and decline,
with no thought of bloodshed, nor black-lists, nor social disdain, contempt,
and persecution.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Southerner is generous in some things, and honorable in
many; but he is not yet a good citizen for a republic. That is the
whole trouble. He must be made so, or stand back for his children.
He needs a firm, resolute guidance—not unkindly unless he will
have it so—but firm, always firm. The moment we waver, he
wavers. When he fully and finally understands that his old undue
political importance is irrevocably a thing of the past, he will take
the first step on the road to valuable citizenship. But between Andrew
Johnson and the ‘Great Democratic Reaction,’ he has come
to believe in the speedy overthrow of the Republican party, and in
the restoration of the slave dynasty to reign over a dominant party,
composed of Southern extremists and Northern doughfaces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That among these freedmen till lately slaves, there are many
who have very inadequate notions of the value and importance
of the ballot, and whose knowledge of our political institutions,
is very limited, is undoubtedly true; but they hardly suffer
even in these respects by comparison with the ignorant poor
whites of the South; a class much slower to learn on these subjects
than the most stupid of the negroes, and among the latter
there are men who in intellect and eloquence are the peers
of any of the white legislators of the South, brilliant as some
of them have been. In the report of the debates of the Constitutional
Convention in Arkansas, which adjourned in March
last, we find a speech of W. H. Gray, a full-blooded negro,
and till recently a slave, but at that time a member of the
Convention, on this very subject, which may safely be placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>by the side of any speech of any white Senator or Representative
from that State in either House of Congress. We have
read carefully the debates of the fathers of the American Republic
on the Declaration of Independence, and we can find
in them nothing more manly or statesmanlike in tone, or more
logical in argument, than the speech of this negro orator. It
is a defense of the right of his people to suffrage which it
would be very difficult for any white man to gainsay or refute.
The question of Impartial Suffrage was before the Convention,
and Mr. Gray said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, sir, having stood by the government and the old flag in
times of trouble, when the Republic trembled with the throes of civil
war, from centre to circumference, from base to cope, for this and
other considerations we are here not to ask charity at the hands of
the honorable body, but to receive, at the hands of the people of
Arkansas in convention assembled, the apportionment of our rights,
as assigned by the Reconstruction Acts of Congress. I am here,
sir, to see those rights of citizenship engrafted in the organic law of
this State. The gentleman from White County does not seem to recognize
the fact that the present constitution is not in accordance with
the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing to each State a
republican form of government. The gentleman from White says
the negro cannot become a citizen. The fact is patent that we have
exercised those rights under the constitution in all the States except
South Carolina, and voted for that time-honored instrument—the
Federal Constitution—by voting for the men that ratified it. As
free men, we were not denied the right of suffrage under the State
laws on account of color. It seems as though the gentleman had
read the history of our country to little purpose, or at least not as I
have.... Again the gentleman denies us the right of suffrage on
the ground of our ignorance. Why, sir, for every negro vote registered
in this State I can duplicate it with the vote of a white man
that can neither read or write; and still we are charged with ignorance.
I do not deny it, but we are not isolated. If these men
can vote, I see no injustice in permitting me to vote also. And in
this connection I would say that the colored people of this State met
in convention in this city, in 1865, for the purpose of considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>their condition and prospects, and then asked simply for the most
remote recognition of their rights, but it was unheeded. I then said
that I had an unshaken confidence in the eventual justice of the
American. Since then we have crossed the Rubicon, as a nation,
and cannot recede if we would.... We are told a republican form
of government must rest upon the intelligence and virtue of the
masses, and that we have not these qualifications; they are qualities
that are at least susceptible of improvement. In other races of
men—and they were not largely displayed when the Huns, Vandals,
and other tribes were laying waste the fair fields of Italy, or
when the Danes and Normans were making sad havoc of your ancestral
estates—our condition would compare favorably with that
of England, as described by Macaulay, at the time of the conquest
of the island by the legions of Cæsar, when he says the condition of
the people was little better than that of the Sandwich Islanders.
We were not far behind those who sold civilized women along the
banks of the James for 200 pounds of tobacco, or less. Nor has our
intelligence, even in a barbarous state, been much below the level of
those who ate the acorns falling from the lofty oak of Dodona, and
worshipped the tree from which they fell. The civilization of the
nineteenth century is the product of 800 years; and with this start
ahead, with all the wealth, intelligence, and power and prestige of
a great government, men pretend to believe that they are afraid of
negro domination, afraid that 4,000,000 of negroes, scattered over
this vast country, will rule 30,000,000 of intelligent white people.
They cannot believe it. But they are endeavoring to work on the
prejudices of the masses, to produce outrage and bloodshed; and, if
possible, what they pretend to deprecate, a war of races. But, sir,
this I do not fear, so long as we are led by the best minds of the nation,
and count in our ranks those distinguished men of both sections,
whose gleaming swords were seen flashing on many a skirmish line
and in the smoke of battle. The gentleman says we are not citizens,
by the highest judicial decision. That decision, sir, travelled outside
of American History, outside of the presence of the courts; and hence
I regard Chief Justice Taney as the American Jeffries. Could I
afford to trust my dearest rights in the hands of men who hold up
such a decision as the measure of my rights, and at the same time
profess to be my best friends? I beg respectfully to decline such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>friendship—men who are willing to consign us to a system of peonage
worse than slavery, a system that strips us of every right or privilege,
and turns us bound hand and foot over to the tender mercies
of mob law....</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man cannot prevent it, for God has written it in burning characters
across the pages of American History—emblazoned it as upon
a sign-board, and hung it on the brows of the Rocky Mountains—‘This
is the asylum for the oppressed of all nations, and all people.’
This is according to the original contract, drawn up by those patriotic
men of the Revolution, and I believe they were honest when they declared
that ‘All men are created equal.’ I believe the hand of an
angel guided the pen that wrote those words, and that they were recorded
in heaven. God intends you shall keep the original contract.
The acting in bad faith by the children of those good men, has cost
the country a million lives—the flower of the land—and untold
sums of wealth. I believe He intends to demand its fulfillment now,
and I plant myself upon the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution, as defined by the framers of those documents, and expounded
by the leading men of that period, and claim that they
secure me my rights, if honestly and faithfully executed. Settle at
once and forever the question of human rights by giving us equality
before the law. Then, and not till then, will peace come to our
borders. Until that is done, capital will not seek investment within
our limits, nor will immigration flow to a State that continues to oppress
and crush the laborer. Arkansas has tried it for thirty years,
and she is still comparatively a vast forest. With an extent of territory
sufficient for an empire,—stretching from Missouri on the north
to Louisiana and Texas on the south, from the Cherokee territory
on the west to where her eastern front looks out on the Father of
Waters; with internal streams sufficiently navigable to bear the commerce
of an empire to the sea,—thirty years a State and not a railroad
worth the name, no means of inter-communication, except that
employed in a by-gone age. Not a respectable school-house, and her
primeval forests still keeping silent guard along her watercourses:
and why? because her soil was desecrated by Slavery. It was here
this Moloch of the nineteenth century reared his altars and sacrificed
his human victims. God has removed the idol and shattered the altars,
and those that opposed it, like the devotees that cast themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>before the Hindoo car of Juggernaut, will be crushed beneath the
progress of the age.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The pictures of the condition of the South in the beginning
of the present year were gloomy in the extreme. We
have taken in preference the testimony of moderate men who
have spent some months in the South during the early part of
the present year. One of these, a Mr. D., for a long time,
and we believe still, connected with the “Cincinnati Gazette,”
gives in January, 1868, the following summary of the condition
of affairs from his own personal observation:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is literally ‘no show’ for an outspoken Union man. He
is socially ostracized; nobody will trade with him. If he be a
farmer, his horses are stolen, his stock dies suddenly, his fences mysteriously
disappear, ‘spontaneous combustion’ destroys his out-houses;
and if he is still foolish enough to misunderstand these
‘manifestations of Providence,’ he is accidentally shot, or some
equally broad hint is given him to leave. To learn these facts, leave
the railroad towns and live in the interior for a few months, and you
will get your fill. I believe that even Andrew Johnson himself
might be reformed, provided he could visit Mississippi <em>incog.</em>, and
stay at the house of a Union man even a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But to know Rebeldom in its truest character, you must leave its
dealings with white men, and view its dealings with the negro. It
could not be expected that the relations existing between the whites
and their late chattels would be very decidedly cordial, for it will be
years ere former owners can calmly view what was once their property
and source of wealth now toiling for themselves; but still common
humanity would dictate a treatment toward the negroes fully as
generous as that usually extended to brutes. Villainy of the whites
is the cause of three fourths of the destitution among the negroes. In
four cases in five where he has worked for a white man, either on
shares or wages, the negro has been defrauded out of his earnings.
If a crop has been raised on shares, it is disposed of by the land-owner,
and if the laborer receives one half his dues he is most
fortunate; if he is employed by the year, he is turned adrift as soon
as crops are gathered, and he is given but a moiety of his wages;
when he asks for the balance due, he is cursed and threatened, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>if he persists in his demand, he is knocked down, or, more often,
shot; if he resents the blow, his death is certain, for no negro dare
strike a white man here, unless there be a company of soldiers present.
To kill a negro is no crime here, and I have heard men talk
of their exploits in this line with the utmost complacency. The
only protection that the colored man now has in the South is the
Freedmen’s Bureau, backed up by Federal bayonets. Break up the
Bureau before reconstruction is effected, and the colored race will be
exterminated in ten years, unless a ‘war of races’ ensues, and the
whites be brought to their senses thereby. It appears to be the
policy of not a few leaders to bring about such a conflict. The
excessive tyranny practiced upon the poor blacks, and the appeals
to the prejudices and baser passions of the whites, tend to that end,
and certainly must have that object.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great destitution prevails in the interior of Alabama and Mississippi,
but it is by no means so severe as has been represented. Here
again is another fiendish device of the opponents of reconstruction.
The colored laborer is defrauded out of most of his earnings. As a
consequence, he is in want, and his family are nigh to starvation.
This is heralded forth to the world as an evidence of the negro’s
natural laziness and disability to take care of himself. If the whites
had dealt justly and generously by their colored laborers, they would
not now be asking alms of the North, nor begging relief of government.
It makes me mourn for the white race when I witness their
oppression of the negro. A just Providence cannot permit such
iniquities to be perpetrated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The prime cause of Southern want is the laziness of the whites.
The Southern climate is notoriously enervating, and is made the excuse
for not working by the ‘privileged classes.’ At every cross-roads
doggery, every shop, and every store in every town and village,
is to be found a crowd of long-haired, stalwart fellows engaged in
whittling sticks, chewing tobacco, and cursing the negro—three
things which they do well and industriously follow up. Without a
dollar, save what they make or defraud their laborers out of, they
spend their time, week in and week out, in idleness, regretting ‘old
times,’ instead of turning to work and industriously striving to retrieve
their fallen fortunes. They have land in abundance, but this
few only will sell, lest the negroes get a foothold and become property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>owners. The South is by no means as impoverished as has
been represented. The Southern people still have in abundance all
the elements of wealth, and it only requires industry among the
whites, and encouragement and fair dealing toward the colored laborers,
to raise the late Rebel States to even a higher state of prosperity
than they ever before enjoyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Still amid all this gloom and darkness there were some
gleams of light. <span class='sc'>Education</span> is and has been, for the past
two years, advancing in the South with a rapidity hitherto
unknown. Heretofore in most of the Southern States, everywhere
except in the large towns, education was only the boon
of the wealthy, and the poor white had almost as little chance
of learning to read and write as the slave, to whom all knowledge
of books was prohibited by law under the severest penalties.
But now, thanks to the efforts of the philanthropic
citizens of the North, the Missionary Associations, Home
Missionary Societies, Freedmen’s Aid Societies and Commissions,
and to the Freedmen’s Bureau, there were thousands
of schools where the negro and the child of the poor white
were taught the elements of knowledge, and an intense rivalry,
in which truth compels us to say the negro child oftenest
came out winner, ensued between the two in regard to the
rapid acquisition of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>This laudable enterprise for the general diffusion of education
in the South was powerfully aided and will continue to
be so by the munificent gift by George Peabody, Esq., of the
sum of more than two millions of dollars, the income of which
is to be distributed annually to southern schools and institutions
of learning, without distinction of color or race. Several
institutions have been founded in Washington, D. C.,
Wilmington, N. C., New Orleans, and Pittsburgh for the
higher education of colored young men, with a view to qualify
them for teachers and preachers among their own people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The constitutional conventions of the desolated States have
wisely incorporated into their bills of rights and their constitutions
the right and the provision for universal education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>and the legislatures elected are manifesting a willingness to
tax themselves for this purpose, to an extent which, in their
present impoverished condition, is highly creditable to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of this will be that in a few years the mass of
voters in the Southern States will be equal in intelligence
to the people of any other section of the country, or to any
nation in the world, and with that intelligence they may
safely be trusted to govern themselves. In all countries and
states, and at all times, ignorance, which brings in its train all
other vices, has been the worst foe of good government. But
with an intelligent and enterprising people no form of despotism,
neither autocracy, oligarchy, or mob law, can prevail.
Hence dark as may be the clouds which now overhang the
South, we look confidently for a brighter future, when its
despotic aristocracy shall no longer hold sway.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER LXXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>IMPEACHMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The determination of the President to proceed with his
own plan of restoring the states lately in insurrection to their
former status, in violation of all law, and of the rights of the
Legislative branch of the Government, to whom this work
had been confided by the constitution, as well as the defiant
and hostile spirit he manifested toward all who opposed
his course, led many of the members of both houses of Congress
to feel that it would be necessary to check his career by
impeachment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still there was a very great reluctance to resort to such an
extreme measure, except under circumstances of extraordinarily
aggravated offence. Many of the Republican members
believed for months that Mr. Johnson’s course was merely
experimental, and that he would ere long return to harmony
and co-operation with the party which had elected him to the
Vice-Presidency; and entertaining this view, they were unwilling
to resort to any measures which should alienate him
still more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The more advanced Republicans were convinced that these
views were erroneous; that Mr. Johnson really sought a
breach with the Republicans; that he was at heart a Democrat,
and in sympathy with the Rebel leaders; that his violations
of the laws and of the rights of Congress had been deliberate
and intentional, and that he intended to continue his
course so long as he could do it with impunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first positive movement looking toward impeachment,
was made on the 17th of December, 1866, when the Hon.
James M. Ashley, of Ohio, moved a suspension of the rules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>to enable him to report, from the Committee on Territories, a
resolution for the appointment of a select committee of seven
by the Speaker, to inquire whether any acts had been done
by any officer of the Government of the United States, which
in contemplation of the constitution, were high crimes, or misdemeanors,
&amp;c. The suspension of the rules was refused,
(two-thirds being necessary). Yeas, 90; nays, 49.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 7th of January, 1867, Hon. Ben. F. Loan, of Missouri,
moved a resolution, (which was referred to the Committee
on Reconstruction), declaring it the imperative duty
of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, (among other things), to take,
without delay, such action as would accomplish the impeachment
of the officer now exercising the functions pertaining to
the office of President of the United States of America, and
his removal from said office upon his conviction, in due form
of law, of the high crimes and misdemeanors of which he is
manifestly and notoriously guilty, and which render it unsafe
longer to permit him to exercise the powers he has unlawfully
assumed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same day, Hon. John R. Kelso, of Missouri, offered
a resolution of nearly similar tenor, which was referred to
the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same day, Hon. James M. Ashley, of Ohio, offered,
as a question of privilege, the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do impeach Andrew Johnson, Vice-President and acting President of the
United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I charge him with a usurpation of power and violation of law;</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that he has corruptly used the appointing power;</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that he has corruptly used the pardoning power;</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that he has corruptly used the veto power;</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that he has corruptly disposed of public property of the United States;</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that he has corruptly interfered in elections, and committed acts which,
in contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and misdemeanors;
Therefore,</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Be it resolved</em>, That the Committee on the Judiciary be, and they are hereby
authorized to inquire into the official conduct of Andrew Johnson, Vice-President
of the United States, discharging the powers and duties of the office of
President of the United States, and to report to this House whether, in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>opinion, the said Andrew Johnson, while in said office, has been guilty of acts
which are designed or calculated to overthrow, subvert, or corrupt the Government
of the United States, or any department or office thereof; and whether
the said Andrew Johnson has been guilty of any act, or has conspired with
others to do acts, which, in contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes
and misdemeanors, requiring the interposition of the constitutional power of
this House; and that said committee have power to send for persons and papers,
and to administer the customary oath to witnesses.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This resolution was adopted by a vote of 108 to 39. The subject was frequently
discussed during the session.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Judiciary Committee, on the 3d of March, reported that it had not concluded
its investigation, but that, in the opinion of the majority, eight to one,
“sufficient testimony had been brought to the notice of the Committee to justify
and demand a further prosecution of the investigation.” The Judiciary Committee
of the XLth Congress was empowered to continue the investigation, by
action had on the 7th of March.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Judiciary Committee reported November 25th, 1867. The majority, consisting
of Messrs. George S. Boutwell, Francis Thomas, Thomas Williams, William
Lawrence, and John C. Churchill, favored impeachment. Messrs. James F. Wilson
and Frederick E. Woodbridge united in a report opposed thereto, and Marshall
and Eldridge signed another minority report. Debate on these reports began
in the House December 5th, and closed the 7th. The impeachment resolution
was then lost, 57 to 108. The affirmative were all Republicans. In the negative
were 67 Republicans and 41 Democrats; there were 20 absentees, 16 Republicans
and 4 Democrats. The following is the vote in detail:</p>

<p class='c000'>It was conceded on all hands that this was the end of impeachment
for that time at least, and it was thought that, the
President, feeling that his conduct had brought down upon
him the censure of a large body of the Members of Congress,
who though they were not willing to proceed to extremities,
still disapproved of his course, would, for the future, act more
wisely, and refrain from those overt acts which might bring
him into further collision with Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>But those who reasoned thus with regard to Andrew Johnson,
knew nothing of his character. Elated with his victory,
he could not conceal his disposition to show his defiance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>Congress by further and more considerable acts of aggression.
He interfered in several of the desolated states which were
about voting upon the question of calling a convention, and
electing delegates to prepare a new constitution, suggesting
to them ways and means of thwarting the reconstruction
measures; continued so far as possible his systematic removals
of loyal and incorruptible officers, and nominated to their
places corrupt men, whom the Senate could not confirm without
becoming partners in corruption; and in every way possible
made known his determination to defy Congress, which
he believed he could now do, with impunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th of January, 1868, Congress having decided
that his suspension of Secretary Stanton was illegal, and that
he must be reinstated, General Grant, who had been Secretary
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span></i>, quietly relinquished the War Office to Secretary
Stanton, and notified the President that he had done so.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very bitter correspondence ensued between the President
and General Grant, (the General, however, keeping his temper),
in which the President charged Grant with duplicity,
treachery and inveracity because he had not given him previous
notice of his intention of surrendering the office to
Secretary Stanton, so that he (Johnson) might have put some
one in possession who would have prevented Secretary Stanton’s
reinstatement. The whole issue between the President
and the General was, in fact, that the President had intended
to violate the Tenure of Office Act and defy the Senate, and
General Grant by his judicious course, had prevented him
from doing so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excitement growing out of this correspondence, and
of the attempts of Mr. Johnson to compel General Grant not
to issue his orders through the War Department, had not died
out, when Mr. Johnson prepared, by a new act of aggression,
to show his defiance of Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 21st of February, 1868, he sent the following order
to Secretary Stanton, by Brevet Major-General Lorenzo
Thomas, Adjutant-General of the Army, a subordinate of
the Secretary:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Secretary Stanton being satisfied that under the Tenure of
Office Act, the President had no power to remove him, refused
obedience, and ordered Gen. Thomas to his own office. The
General refused to go, and expressed his determination to
obtain possession by force, if necessary. That he understood
at the time that the President had authorized him to use force
if necessary, there can be no doubt; whether he understood
Mr. Johnson correctly, may be a question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Stanton continued in possession, and notified Congress
of the action of the President, and of what he had done.</p>

<p class='c000'>This act was so plainly a violation both of the Tenure of
Office Act, and the rights of the Senate, that it produced at
once the most intense excitement, and convinced those who
had hitherto doubts, that impeachment was necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same day, February 21st, Mr. Covode, of Pennsylvania,
offered a resolution that the President be impeached,
which was referred to the Committee on Reconstruction. On
the 22d of February, (Saturday,) Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania,
from the Committee on Reconstruction, made the following
report:</p>

<p class='c013'>That, in addition to the papers referred to, the Committee find that the President,
on the 21st day of February, 1868, signed and ordered a commission or

This motion prevailed, and on the 25th of February,
Messrs. Thaddeus Stevens and John A. Bingham, of the
House of Representatives, appeared before the bar of the
Senate, and read the following announcement:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. President</span>: In obedience to the order of the House of Representatives,
we have appeared before you, and in the name of the House of Representatives
and of all the people of the United States, we do impeach Andrew
Johnson, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors in
office; and we further inform the Senate that the House of Representatives
will in due time exhibit particular articles of impeachment against him, and
make good the same; and in their name we demand that the Senate take due
order for the appearance of the said Andrew Johnson, to answer to the said
Impeachment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The President <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</span></i> replied: The Senate will take order
in the premises.</p>

<p class='c000'>A committee of seven, appointed by the President, and consisting
of Messrs. Howard, Trumbull, Conkling, Edmunds,
Morton, Pomeroy, and Johnson, were on motion of Mr. Howard,
directed to consider and report upon this announcement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between this date and the 4th of March, the action of the
House was mainly confined to the preparation of the Articles
of Impeachment, their adoption, and the election of Managers
of the Impeachment. The Managers elected were Mr. Stevens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>of Pennsylvania, Mr. Butler of Massachusetts, Mr. Bingham
of Ohio, Mr. Boutwell of Massachusetts, Mr. Wilson of Iowa,
Mr. Williams of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Logan of Illinois.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Wednesday, March 4th, the series of Articles of Impeachment
which had passed the House, were presented to the
Senate by a House Committee. They were as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Article 1.</span> That said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, on
the 21st day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-eight, at Washington, in the District of Columbia, unmindful of the
high duties of his office, his oath of office, and of the requirement of the Constitution
that he should take care that the laws be faithfully executed, did unlawfully
and in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, issue
an order in writing for the removal of Edwin M. Stanton from the office of
Secretary for the Department of War, said Edwin M. Stanton having been,
theretofore, duly appointed and commissioned by and with the consent of the
Senate of the United States as such Secretary; and said Andrew Johnson,
President of the United States, on the 12th day of August, in the year of our

to said Senate such suspension, with the evidence and reasons for his
action in the case, and the name of the person designated to perform the duties
of such office temporarily until the next meeting of the Senate, and said Senate
there-afterward on the 13th day of January, in the year of our Lord 1868, having
duly considered the evidence and reasons reported by said Andrew Johnson
for said suspension, did refuse to concur in said suspension, whereby, and by
force of provision of an act entitled “An act regulating the tenure of certain
civil offices,” passed March 2, 1867, said Edwin M. Stanton did forthwith resume
the functions of his office, whereof the said Andrew Johnson had then
and there due notice, and said Edwin M. Stanton, by reason of the premises on
said 21st day of February, was lawfully entitled to hold said office of Secretary
for the Department of War, which said order for the removal of said Edwin M.
Stanton is, in substance, as follows, that is to say:</p>

bring before him then and there, William H. Emory, a Major-General by brevet
in the Army of the United States, actually in command of the Department of
Washington, and the military forces thereof, and did then and there, as such
Commander-in-Chief, declare to and instruct said Emory, that part of a law of

for the support of the army for the year ending June 30, 1868, and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>other purposes,” especially the second section thereof, which provides among
other things, that “all orders in instructions relating to military operations issued
by the President or Secretary of War shall be issued through the General
of the Army, and in case of his inability, through the next in rank,” was unconstitutional
and in contravention of the commission of said Emory, and
therefore not binding on him as an officer in the Army of the United States,
which said provision of law had been theretofore duly and legally promulgated
by general order for the government and direction of the Army of the United
States, as the said Andrew Johnson then and there well knew, with intent
thereby to induce said Emory in his official capacity as Commander of the Department
of Washington to violate the provisions of said act, and to take and
receive, act upon, and obey such orders as he, the said Andrew Johnson, might
make and give, and which should not be issued through the General of the
Army of the United States, according to the provisions of said act, whereby
said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, did then and there commit
and was guilty of a high misdemeanor in office; and the House of Representatives,
by protestation, saving to themselves the liberty of exhibiting at any
time hereafter any further articles or other accusation or impeachment against
the said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, and also of replying
to his answer which he shall make to the articles herein preferred against him,
and of offering proof to the same and every part thereof, and to all and every
other article, accusation or impeachment which shall be exhibited by them as
the case shall require, do demand that the said Andrew Johnson may be put to
answer the high crimes and misdemeanors in office herein charged against him,
and that such proceedings, examinations, trials and judgments may be thereupon
had and given as may be agreeable to law and justice.</p>

<p class='c013'>To these Articles was afterward added:</p>

of the high duties of his office and of the dignity and proprieties thereof,
and of the harmony and courtesies which ought to exist and be maintained
between the executive and legislative branches of the Government of the United
States, designing and intending to set aside the rightful authority and powers
of Congress, did attempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and
reproach, the Congress of the United States and the several branches thereof,
to impair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of the United
States for the Congress and legislative power thereof, which all officers of the
Government ought inviolately to preserve and maintain, and to excite the odium
and resentment of all the good people of the United States against Congress and
the laws by it duly and constitutionally enacted; and in pursuance of his said
design and intent, openly and publicly, and before divers assemblages of the
citizens of the United States convened in divers parts thereof, to meet and receive
said Andrew Johnson as the Chief Magistrate of the United States, did on
the 18th day of August, in the year of our Lord 1866, and on divers other days
and times, as well before as afterward, make and deliver, with a loud voice, certain
intemperate, inflammatory and scandalous harangues, and did therein utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>loud threats and bitter menaces, as well against Congress as the laws of the
United States, duly enacted thereby, amid the cries, jeers, and laughter of the
multitude then assembled and in hearing, which are set forth in the several specifications
hereinafter written, in substance and effect; that is to say:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Specification 1.</em>—In this, that at Washington, in the District of Columbia, in
the Executive Mansion, to a committee of citizens who called upon the President
of the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress of the
United States, said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, heretofore,
to wit: on the 18th day of August, in the year of our Lord, 1866, did in a loud
voice declare, in substance and effect, among other things, that is to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far as the Executive Department of the Government is concerned, the effort
has been made to restore the Union, to heal the breach, to pour oil into the
wounds which were consequent upon the struggle, and to speak in a common
phrase, to prepare, as the learned and wise physician would, a plaster healing
in character, and coextensive with the wound. We thought, and we think, that
we had partially succeeded, but as the work progresses, as reconstruction seemed
to be taking place, and the country was becoming reunited, we found a disturbing
and marring element opposing us. In alluding to that element I shall
go no further than your Convention, and the distinguished gentleman who has
delivered to me the report of the proceedings. I shall make no reference to it
that I do not believe the time and the occasion justify. We have witnessed in
one department of the Government every endeavor to prevent the restoration
of peace, harmony and union. We have seen hanging upon the verge of the
Government, as it were, a body called, or which assumes to be the Congress of
the United States, while in fact it is a Congress of only part of the States. We
have seen this Congress pretend to be for the Union, when its every step and act
tended to perpetuate disunion, and make a disruption of the States inevitable.
We have seen Congress gradually encroach, step by step, upon Constitutional
rights, and violate day after day, and month after month, fundamental principles
of the Government. We have seen a Congress that seemed to forget that
there was a limit to the sphere and scope of legislation. We have seen a Congress
in a minority assume to exercise power, which if allowed to be consummated,
would result in despotism, in monarchy itself.”</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Specification 2.</em>—In this, that at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, heretofore,
to wit: on the 3d day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-six, before a public assemblage of citizens and others,
said Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, speaking of and concerning
the Congress of the United States, did in a loud voice declare in substance
and effect, among other things, that is to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you what I did do. I called upon your Congress, that is trying to
break up the Government. In conclusion, besides, that Congress had taken
much pains to poison their constituents against him. But what has Congress
done? Have they done anything to restore the Union of these States? No!
On the contrary, they had done everything to prevent it, and, because he stood
now where he did when the Rebellion commenced, he had been denounced as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>traitor. Who had run greater risks or made greater sacrifices than himself?
But Congress, factious and domineering, had undertaken to poison the minds
of the American people.”</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Specification 3.</em>—In this, that at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, heretofore,
to wit, on the 8th day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1866, before a
public assemblage of citizens and others, said Andrew Johnson, President of
the United States, speaking of and concerning the Congress of the United
States, did in a loud voice declare in substance and effect, among other things,
that is to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on; perhaps if you had a word or two on the subject of New Orleans
you might understand more about it than you do, and if you will go back and
ascertain the cause of the riot at New Orleans, perhaps you will not be so prompt
in calling out ‘New Orleans.’ If you will take up the riot of New Orleans and
trace it back to its source or its immediate cause, you will find out who was responsible
for the blood that was shed there. If you will take up the riot at New
Orleans and trace it back to the Radical Congress, you will find that the riot at
New Orleans was substantially planned. If you will take up the proceedings in
their caucuses, you will understand that they there knew that a Convention
was to be called, which was extinct, by its power having expired; that it was said
that the intention was that a new government was to be organized, and on the
organization of that government the intention was to enfranchise one portion of
the population, called the colored population, who had just been emancipated,
and at the same time disfranchise white men. When you design to talk about
New Orleans you ought to understand what you are talking about. When you
read the speeches that were made, and take up the facts on the Friday and
Saturday before that Convention sat, you will find that speeches were made, incendiary
in their character, exciting that portion of the population—the black
population—to arm themselves and prepare for the shedding of blood. You
will also find that that Convention did assemble in violation of law, and the intention
of that Convention was to supersede the organized authorities in the State
government of Louisiana, which had been organized by the Government of the
United States, and every man engaged in that rebellion, in that Convention, with
the intention of superseding and upturning the civil government which had been
recognized by the United States, I say that he was a traitor to the Constitution
of the United States, and hence you find that another rebellion was commenced,
having its origin in the Radical Congress. So much for the New Orleans riot;
and there was the cause and the origin of the blood that was shed, and every
drop of blood that was shed is upon their skirts, and they are responsible
for it. I could test this thing a little closer, but will not do it here to-night; but
when you talk about the causes and consequences that resulted from proceedings
of that kind, perhaps as I have been introduced here and you have provoked
questions of this kind, though it does not provoke me, I will tell you a
few wholesome things that have been done by this Radical Congress, in connection
with New Orleans, and the extension of elective franchise. I know that I
have been traduced and abused. I know that it has come in advance of me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>here as elsewhere. That <em>I have attempted to exercise an arbitrary power in resisting
laws that were intended to be forced upon the Government, that I had exercised
that power, that I had abandoned the party that elected me, and that I was a
traitor, because I exercised the veto power in attempting, and I did arrest for a
time the bill that was called a Freedman’s Bureau Bill. Yes, I was a traitor,
and I have been traduced, I have been slandered, I have been maligned, I have
been called Judas Iscariot</em>, and all that. Now my countrymen here to-night, it is
very easy to indulge in epithets. It is easy to call a man Judas and cry out
traitor; but when he is called upon to give arguments and facts he is very often
found wanting. Judas Iscariot; Judas! There was a Judas and he was one of
the twelve Apostles. Oh yes, the twelve Apostles had a Christ, and he never
could have had a Judas unless he had had twelve Apostles. If I have played
the Judas, who has been my Christ that I have played the Judas with? Was
it Thad. Stevens? Was it Wendell Phillips? Was it Charles Sumner? These
are the men that stop and compare themselves with the Saviour, and every body
that differs with them in opinion, and who try to stay and arrest their diabolical
and nefarious policy, is to be denounced as a Judas. Well, let me say to you,
if you will stand by me in this action; <em>if you will stand by me in trying to give
the people a fair chance, soldiers and citizens, to participate in these offices, God
being willing I will kick them out. I will kick them out just as fast as I can.
Let me say to you, in conclusion, that what I have said, I intended to say. I was
not provoked into this</em>, and I care not for their menaces, the taunts and the jeers.
I care not for threats, I do not intend to be bullied by my enemies nor overawed
by my friends; but, God willing, with your help, I will veto their measures,
whenever any of them come to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Which said utterances, declarations, threats, and harangues, highly censurable
in any, are peculiarly indecent and unbecoming in the Chief Magistrate of the
United States, by means whereof said Andrew Johnson has brought the high
office of President of the United States into contempt, ridicule, and disgrace, to
the great scandal of all good citizens, whereby said Andrew Johnson, President
of the United States, did commit, and was then and there guilty of high
misdemeanor in office.</p>

<p>THE HIGH COURT OF IMPEACHMENT.<br /><br /><span class='c009'>(THE ARTIST MADE A JOURNEY TO WASHINGTON ON PURPOSE TO MAKE THE DRAWING—IT IS RELIABLE.)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>The Senate having adopted rules for the trial, reported by
its committee, proceeded on Thursday, March 5th, to organize
as a Court of Impeachment, Chief Justice Chase presiding.
On Saturday, March 7th, the summons requiring the President
to appear and answer the Articles of Impeachment was
served on him, with a copy of the articles. On Friday, March
13th, the President appeared by his counsel before the Senate
and requested forty days’ time in which to prepare and serve
his answers to the articles. His counsel, as first named, consisted
of Messrs. Evarts, Stanbery, Curtis, Nelson, and Black.
Subsequently, Mr. Black withdrew, and Mr. Groesbeck was
added to the number. The Senate did not comply with the
President’s request, but designated Monday, March 23d, as
the day for the presentation of his answers to the charges,
and they were read before the Senate on that day. On the
following day the Managers of the House presented their replication
to the President’s answers, and it was read before
the Senate. On Monday, March 30th, the great trial began,
Mr. Butler making the opening speech on behalf of the Managers.
The latter at once introduced their testimony, which
consumed six days, until Saturday, April 4th. On Thursday,
April 9th, the President’s counsel began his defense, Mr. Curtis
delivering the opening speech. Nine days were consumed
by them in presenting their testimony, until Saturday, April
18th. Two days later, April 20th, additional testimony was
offered by both sides. On Wednesday, April 22d, Mr. Boutwell
of the Managers began to sum up the case in a protracted
speech. Messrs. Stevens and Bingham likewise spoke for
the prosecution, and Messrs. Nelson, Groesbeck, Evarts, and
Stanbery for the President. Mr. Bingham’s speech, the closing
speech of the trial, was concluded on Wednesday, May
6th. On Thursday, May 7th, the Senate, as the Court of Impeachment,
sat in secret session six hours, during which it
was decided to take the final vote on Tuesday, May 12th.
May 11th, the Court deliberated on impeachment in secret
session, and on the 12th of May, Senator Howard being unable
to take his seat, the final vote was postponed until Saturday,
May 16th.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meantime, painful rumors had been current of the defection
of some of those Republican Senators who had at first appeared
to be earnest and zealous for the President’s impeachment.
These rumors gained strength throughout the week,
and when the vote was taken on Saturday, May 16th, on the
Eleventh Article, which it was thought best to have voted
upon first, the vote stood thirty-five for conviction to nineteen
for acquittal, and as the Constitution requires a two-thirds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>vote for conviction, Mr. Johnson was technically acquitted on
this article.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>The Votes for Conviction were</span>:—Anthony, Cameron, Cattell, Chandler,
Cole, Conkling, Conness, Corbett, Cragin, Drake, Edmunds, Ferry, Frelinghuysen,
Harlan, Howard, Howe, Morgan, Morrill, (Me.) Morrill, (Vt.) Morton,
Nye, Patterson, (N. H.) Pomeroy, Ramsey, Sherman, Sprague, Stewart, Sumner,
Thayer, Tipton, Wade, Willey, Williams, Wilson, Yates—35.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>For Acquittal</span>:—Bayard, Buckalew, Davis, Dixon, Doolittle, Fessenden,
Fowler, Grimes, Henderson, Hendricks, Johnson, McCreery, Norton, Patterson,
(Tenn.) Ross, Saulsbury, Trumbull, Van Winkle, Vickers—19.</p>

<p class='c000'>Messrs. Fessenden, Fowler, Grimes, Henderson, Ross, Trumbull,
and Van Winkle, all hitherto regarded as stanch Republicans,
voted with the Democrats, and by their votes prevented
the conviction of the President of the high crimes and misdemeanors
of which he was accused. Other Senators, the peers
of any of these in legal attainment and judicial ability, were
fully convinced that the Managers had made out their case
conclusively, and some of these also have admitted their
belief in his guilt, but professed to find objections to the
phraseology of the Articles of Impeachment. That the course
of these seven Senators disappointed their friends, and gave
encouragement to the enemies of reconstruction, can not be
gainsaid. That it caused painful surmisings in regard to
their motives, is equally true.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of almost any other man, an escape from conviction
and deposition from his high station by the lack of one
vote to make up two-thirds, and this not without strong suspicion
of the purchase of that vote on his part, would be a
lesson sufficiently severe to secure the most decorous behavior
for the remainder of his term, if for no other reason than that
he might avert the judgment still hanging over him by a
slender hair; but as we have already shown, there is no reason
from Mr. Johnson’s past conduct, to expect anything more
than an aggravation of his previous offences, and a determination
to vent upon the nation all the malignity of his bitter
and vindictive nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>But to proceed with the record. After the vote on the
Eleventh Article, further action was postponed till the 26th
of May. On that day the second and third articles were voted
upon, with precisely the same result as before, and as it was
evident that a conviction could not be secured, the record of
technical acquittal on the second, third and eleventh articles
was entered, and the High Court of Impeachment adjourned
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</span></i>. On the same day, Mr. Stanton sent his relinquishment
of the office of Secretary of War to the President, feeling
that as Impeachment had failed, it was best for him to
withdraw.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days later, General J. M. Schofield, who had previously
been nominated, was confirmed by the Senate as Secretary
of War, the Senate declaring that it was in the place of
Edwin M. Stanton, unlawfully removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <em>interim</em> between the two votes on the question of Impeachment,
the National Republican Union Convention was
held at Chicago, and Ulysses S. Grant nominated for the
Presidency by the unanimous vote of all the delegates, 650
in number, on the first ballot. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana,
was nominated for Vice-President on the fifth ballot, receiving
by the change of votes of State delegations, 522 out of 650
votes. The balloting previous to these changes which were
incident to the conviction that he had the majority, was as
follows:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>The canvass for Mr. Colfax at the Convention was conducted
on strictly temperance principles, Mr. Colfax having expressly
requested his friend, Mr. Defrees, who conducted it,
to permit no intoxicating liquor on the premises.</p>

<p class='c000'>The platform on which the Convention have placed these
candidates, whose names win all hearts, is worthy of the men.
It is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>The National Republican Party of the United States, assembled in National
Convention in the City of Chicago, on the 21st day of May, 1868, make the following
Declaration of Principles</em>:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. We congratulate the country on the assured success of the Reconstruction
policy of Congress, as evinced by the adoption, in the majority of the States
lately in rebellion, of Constitutions securing Equal Civil and Political Rights to
all, and it is the duty of the Government to sustain those institutions, and to
prevent the people of such States from being remitted to a state of anarchy.</p>

<p class='c013'>II. The guaranty by Congress, of Equal Suffrage to all loyal men at the South,
was demanded by every consideration of public safety, of gratitude, and of justice,
and must be maintained; while the question of Suffrage in all the loyal
States properly belongs to the people of those States.</p>

<p class='c013'>III. We denounce all forms of Repudiation as a national crime; and the national
honor requires the payment of the public indebtedness in the uttermost
good faith to all creditors at home and abroad, not only according to the letter
but the spirit of the laws under which it was contracted.</p>

<p class='c013'>IV. It is due to the Labor of the Nation that taxation should be equalized,
and reduced as rapidly as the national faith will permit.</p>

<p class='c013'>V. The National debt, contracted, as it has been, for the preservation of the
Union for all time to come, should be extended over a fair period for redemption;
and it is the duty of Congress to reduce the rate of interest thereon
whenever it can be honestly done.</p>

<p class='c013'>VI. That the best policy to diminish our burden of debt is to so improve our
credit that capitalists will seek to loan us money at lower rates of interest than
we now pay, so long as repudiation, partial or total, open or covert, is threatened
or suspected.</p>

<p class='c013'>VII. The Government of the United States should be administered with the
strictest economy; and the corruptions which have been so shamefully nursed
and fostered by Andrew Johnson call loudly for radical reform.</p>

<p class='c013'>VIII. We profoundly deplore the untimely and tragic death of Abraham
Lincoln, and regret the accession to the Presidency, of Andrew Johnson, who
has acted treacherously to the people who elected him and the cause he was
pledged to support; who has usurped high legislative and judicial functions; who
has refused to execute the laws; who has used his high office to induce other
officers to ignore and violate the laws; who has employed his executive powers
to render insecure the property, the peace, liberty and life, of the citizen; who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>has abused the pardoning power; who has denounced the National Legislature
as unconstitutional; who has persistently and corruptly resisted, by every means
in his power, every proper attempt at the reconstruction of the States lately in
rebellion; who has perverted the public patronage into an engine of wholesale
corruption; and who has been justly impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,
and properly pronounced guilty thereof by the vote of thirty-five
Senators.</p>

<p class='c013'>IX. The doctrine of Great Britain and other European powers that, because
a man is once a subject he is always so, must be resisted at every hazard by the
United States, as a relic of feudal times not authorized by the laws of nations,
and at war with our national honor and independence. Naturalized citizens are
entitled to protection in all their rights of citizenship, as though they were native-born;
and no citizen of the United States, native or naturalized, must be liable
to arrest and imprisonment by any foreign power for acts done or words
spoken in this country; and, if so arrested and imprisoned, it is the duty of the
Government to interfere in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c013'>X. Of all who were faithful in the trials of the late war, there were none entitled
to more especial honor than the brave soldiers and seamen who endured
the hardships of campaign and cruise, and imperilled their lives in the service of
the country; the bounties and pensions provided by the laws for these brave
defenders of the nation, are obligations never to be forgotten; the widows and
orphans of the gallant dead are the wards of the people—a sacred legacy bequeathed
to the nation’s protecting care.</p>

<p class='c013'>XI. Foreign immigration, which in the past has added so much to the wealth,
development and resources and increase of power to this republic, the asylum
of the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal
and just policy.</p>

<p class='c013'>XII. This Convention declares itself in sympathy with all oppressed peoples
struggling for their rights.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div><em>Unanimously added, on motion of Gen. Schurz</em>:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved</em>, That we highly commend the spirit of magnanimity and forbearance
with which men who have served in the Rebellion, but who now frankly and
honestly coöperate with us in restoring the peace of the country and reconstructing
the Southern State governments upon the basis of Impartial Justice and
Equal Rights, are received back into the communion of the loyal people; and
we favor the removal of the disqualifications and restrictions imposed upon the
late Rebels in the same measure as their spirit of loyalty will direct, and as
may be consistent with the safety of the loyal people.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved</em>, That we recognize the great principles laid down in the immortal
Declaration of Independence, as the true foundation of democratic government;
and we hail with gladness every effort toward making these principles a living
reality on every inch of American soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>With such a platform, and such candidates, there should
be, there can be, no question of the success of the Republican
<span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>Party in the coming election. The only question should be,
whether any States, except Kentucky and Maryland, can be
allowed to the Democratic Party, and whether the candidate
of that party, whoever he may be, may not need a certificate
after the election, testifying to the fact of his candidacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Reconstruction, Retrenchment, Reform, Equal Rights,
Impartial Suffrage, and No Repudiation, for its cardinal principles,
the great party of Freedom stands firm as the everlasting
hills. It can afford to let traitors and renegades strut
out their brief hour, for the eternal years of God belong to
the party of Freedom and Right, and it may well say in the
grand words of Whittier:</p>

<h3 class='c020'>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF GENERAL U. S. GRANT.</h3>

<p class='c031'>General Ulysses Simpson Grant (or, as he was originally
named, Hiram Ulysses Grant) was born on the 27th of
April, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clement County, Ohio; and
is a descendant, in the eighth generation, of Matthew Grant,
who came from England, in 1630, and was a first settler
of Dorchester, Mass., and subsequently of Windsor, Conn.
His father, Jesse Root Grant, a tanner by trade, and his mother,
Hannah Simpson, were both natives of Pennsylvania, who
had removed to Ohio, and were there married in June, 1821.
The child grew to be a sturdy, fearless, and pertinacious urchin,
whose good nature made him a general favorite, and
whose “ruling passion,” almost from the time he could go
alone, was for horses. At school, he was faithful, diligent, and
painstaking, showing an appreciation of the value of an education,
but developing no especial eminence, except, perhaps,
a fondness for mathematics. But, out of school, he was to be
found not far away from the horses. He learned to drive alone
at the age of seven and a half years, and harnessed horses
when he was so small that he had to get up into the manger
to put the bridle and collar on, and then turn over the half-bushel
and stand on it, in order to throw the harness on.
And when a circus, or travelling show, came through the village
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a02'>a02</span>where he was, or into its neighborhood, he was inevitably
“on hand.” If the ring-master called out for some boy in the
audience to try and ride the pony, little Ulysses would present
himself, eager to seize the opportunity, “and,” says his father
in the “New York Ledger,” “whatever he undertook to ride
he rode.” This practice he kept up, until he got to be so
large that he was ashamed to ride a pony.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Supposing many readers of this volume would like to read something
of the life of General U. S. Grant, we insert this sketch for their benefit.—<em>Publisher.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>“Once, when he was a boy, a show came along in which there
was a mischievous pony, trained to go round the ring like
lightning, and which was expected to throw any boy that attempted
to ride him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Will any boy come forward and ride this pony?’”
shouted the ring-master.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ulysses stepped forward, and mounted the pony. The
performance began. Round and round the ring went the
pony, faster and faster, making the greatest effort to dismount
his rider. But Ulysses sat as steady as if he had
grown to the pony’s back. Presently out came a large monkey
and sprang up behind Ulysses. The people set up a
great shout of laughter, and on the pony ran; but it all produced
no effect on the rider. Then the ring-master made the
monkey jump up upon Ulysses’ shoulders, standing with his
feet on his shoulders, and with his hands holding on to his
hair. At this there was another and a still louder shout, but
not a muscle of Ulysses’ face moved. There was not a tremor
of his nerves. A few more rounds, and the ring-master gave
it up; he had come across a boy that the pony and the monkey
both could not dismount.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ulysses had the habit of riding our horses to water, standing
up on their bare backs. He began this practice when
about five years old. At eight or nine he would ride them at
the top of their speed, standing upon one foot and balancing
himself by the bridle reins. The ground over which he used
to make these performances was a little descending towards
the river; a near neighbor’s boy who undertook to rival him
in speed, although without standing up, was unfortunately
thrown from his horse and killed.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a03'>a03</span>He early acquired the habit of breaking horses to the harness,
and developed a peculiar faculty for training them to pace.
“It became known in the neighborhood,” says his father, in
the article from which we have already quoted, “and people
used to apply to him to break their horses to pace; but he
had an idea that it was degrading, and would never undertake
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One day a neighbor came to me and said, ‘Ulysses has
a remarkable faculty to teach a horse to pace. I have a fine
young horse; now how can I get Ulysses to teach him to
pace?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Said I: ‘You mustn’t say a word to him about it, but
send him on a mission to some place, and get him, while he is
gone, to teach the horse to pace.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Said he, ‘I will do it.’ So he came over again and said to
Ulysses, ‘I want to send a letter, in a hurry, thirteen miles
to Decatur, and I will give you two dollars to get on my horse
and carry it.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ulysses was then nine or ten years old. He was fond of
making money, and fond of that kind of business, and he
answered, ‘I will go.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just as he was starting off the owner of the horse cried out
after him, ‘<em>I want you to teach that horse to pace</em>.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The horse had never paced a step before. But Ulysses
accomplished the task. He returned the horse at night a perfect
pacer. The letter was all a sham. Ulysses found out the
trick, and nobody after that could ever get him to break a
horse to pace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When only ten or twelve years of age, the boy’s energy
and fertility of resource enabled him to render to his father
assistance equal to that of a full-grown man. A remarkable
feat, by which, with only the help of a large stout horse, he
contrived to do the loading and hauling of a large quantity of
fourteen-feet logs for a building which his father was erecting,
is thus described in the fathers own words: “A large
sugar-tree had been felled, so that it lay aslant, one end resting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a04'>a04</span>on the ground and the other elevated. He had hitched
the horse Dave to the end of a hewn log, and hauled it upon
this sugar-tree, the end projecting over far enough to back
the wagon under it. Three made a load; and when he had
got three hauled up in this way, he backed the hind end of
the wagon up under them, and hitching the powerful horse in
front by means of a long chain which extended over the whole
length of the wagon-body, he pulled them, one at a time, into
the wagon. This was much talked of in the neighborhood, as
it was considered a great achievement for a boy of his size.
He worked the whole seven months, and until the job was
finished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The lad, however, showed an evident disrelish for his father’s
business, and a decided preference for some active out-of-door
employment, or for a thorough education. These,
Mr. Grant’s somewhat straitened circumstances prevented him
from attaining; but finally, through the kindness of Senator
Thomas Morris, of Ohio, he heard that the Hon. Thos. L. Hamer,
member of Congress from his own district, had an appointment
to the Military Academy at West Point at his disposal.
On application to him, Ulysses was appointed, and having
passed the preliminary examinations, he entered the Academy
on the 1st of July, 1839. There he manifested the same studious
qualities which he had while in school, ranking No. 21
in his class, of which only thirty-nine out of nearly one hundred
graduated in 1843, his standing being best in artillery and infantry
tactics, mathematics, engineering, and horsemanship.
Upon graduating he was, in consequence of there being no existing
vacancy, made brevet Second Lieutenant of the Tenth
Infantry Regiment, and performed duty as a private for a while
after joining it at Jefferson Barracks, near St. Louis. In 1844,
his regiment removed to Red River in Louisiana; and in
1845, formed a part of the “army of occupation” on the
Texan Border at the beginning of the war with Mexico.
Meanwhile, he had declined the higher rank of First Lieutenant
in the Seventh Infantry; preferring to share the fortunes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a05'>a05</span>of his old regiment, where chance of service seemed more
immediate. In May, 1846, he was distinguished for gallantry
and courage at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma; received
honorable mention for good conduct at the storming of
Monterey; participated, in 1847, in the capture of Vera Cruz,
and was made quartermaster of his regiment, serving in this
capacity during the remainder of the campaign, but showing no
disposition to avail himself of his privilege of remaining in his
own department in time of battle. At the assault of Molino
del Rey, and the storming of Chapultepec, his daring and skill
elicited the highest commendations of his superiors, and he
was made a first lieutenant on the spot. Indeed, the flanking
maneuver by which, with a few men only, he turned and carried
the first barrier at Chapultepec, seems to have been the
germ of the celebrated <em>flanking</em> movements which he has so
often since tried, and with such brilliant success, upon larger
battle-fields. He was brevetted captain for this achievement,
his commission dating from September 13, 1847. He participated
in fourteen battles during the Mexican War, and soon
after its close in August, 1848, was married to Miss Julia A.
Dent, residing near St. Louis, and whose brother, now General
Dent, was one of his West Point classmates. Shortly
after this he was ordered with his regiment to Detroit, Mich.,
and subsequently to Sackett’s Harbor, N. Y. In the autumn
of 1851, his regiment was sent to Oregon, with head-quarters
at Fort Dallas, and while on duty there, August, 1853, he
received his full commission as captain. Seeing but little
prospect, either of active employment or of further promotion,
Grant now decided to return to civil life, and, on the
31st of July, 1854, resigned his commission in the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Retiring to a farm which his wife had received from her
father, about nine miles from St. Louis, Mo., and which his
own father had stocked completely, he entered upon his new
life with his accustomed energy and fidelity, and no man
ever worked harder. He built, in part with his own hands,
a small house of hewn logs, for his family to live in;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a06'>a06</span>and in all the departments of husbandry proved himself a
thorough farmer. In winter he hired help to cut wood, and
hauled it to St. Louis and Carondelet, where he found a market;
and there are many now living who distinctly remember
the present General, as he then appeared, dressed in his blouse,
with old felt hat, and pants tucked into the tops of his boots.
In summer he “turned an honest penny” by acting as collector
of taxes in his county; but, though honest and persevering,
he lacked the stern and unscrupulous character which is
essential to success in that line of business; and the duties of
an auctioneer, at which he occasionally tried his hand, were
equally unsuited to his tastes. After four years of arduous
farming, at the end of which he was not as well off as when
he began, he quitted it and removed to St. Louis, where he
entered the real estate business with a Mr. Boggs. Finding,
after a few months’ trial, that the profits were hardly sufficient
to support two families, he gave up his interest to his partner,
and next obtained a position in the Custom House, which,
however, he held but two months. In 1859 he accepted an
offer of partnership from his father, who with two other sons
was conducting a well-established and profitable leather business
at Galena, Illinois. He entered upon it, taking hold of the
business with his accustomed industry, and speedily becoming
an excellent salesman. Yet he took so little pains to extend
his acquaintance in the place, that his father relates that “after
he had joined the army and had begun to be distinguished,
citizens of the town would stop in front of our store, within six
feet of the windows, and look in to see which of the Grants it
was that was absent and had suddenly become famous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eventful morning when the telegraph flashed to
every corner of this western continent, the news that Sumter
had been fired upon by Southern guns, and with that news
the President’s proclamation calling for 75,000 troops, Grant
was at his store, and his response was prompt and characteristic.
Taking his coat from the counter where it lay, he drew it
on, simply remarking, “Uncle Sam educated me for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a07'>a07</span>army, and although I have served through one war, I feel I
am still a little in debt for my education, and I am ready and
willing to discharge the obligation. I am for the war, to put
down this wicked rebellion.” Into the street he went, talked
with some of his acquaintances, and speedily raised a company
of volunteers, with which he repaired to Springfield and
tendered their services to Governor Yates. That indefatigable
and patriotic State officer has since given the following
interesting account of his first acquaintance with the future hero
of the war: “In April, 1861, he tendered his personal services
to me, saying, that he ‘had been the recipient of a military
education at West Point, and that now, when the country
was involved in a war for its preservation and safety, he
thought it his duty to offer his services in defense of the
Union, and that he would esteem it a privilege to be assigned
to any position where he could be useful.’ The plain, straightforward
demeanor of the man, and the modesty and earnestness
which characterized his offer of assistance, at once awakened
a lively interest in him, and impressed me with a desire
to secure his counsel for the benefit of volunteer organizations
then forming for government service. At first I assigned,
him a desk in the Executive office; and his familiarity with
military organizations and regulations made him an invaluable
assistant in my own and the office of the Adjutant-General.
Soon his admirable qualities as a military commander became
apparent, and I assigned him to the camps of organization at
‘Camp Yates,’ Springfield, ‘Camp Grant,’ Mattoon, and
‘Camp Douglas,’ at Anna, Union County, at which the 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 18th, 19th, and 21st regiments of
Illinois Volunteers, raised under the call of the President of
the 15th of April, and under the ‘Ten Regiment Bill,’ of the
extraordinary session of the legislature convened April 23,
1861, were rendezvoused. His employment had special reference
to the organization and muster of these forces—the
first six into the United States, and the last three into the State
service. This was accomplished about the 10th of May, 1861,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a08'>a08</span>at which time he left the State for a brief period on a visit to
his father, at Covington, Kentucky.” At this juncture Governor
Yates found himself greatly perplexed to find a competent
officer to command the 21st regiment, Illinois Volunteers,
in camp at Mattoon, and which had become much demoralized
by the incompetency of its officers. Acting upon his own
favorable impressions of Grant, and by the earnest advice of
those who knew him best, he telegraphed to Grant to take the
charge of the refractory regiment and bring it into a proper
state of discipline. Grant promptly appeared at Mattoon,
assumed command of the regiment, June 15, 1861, and
removed it to Caseyville for reorganization. In Governor
Yates’s words: “Thirty days previous to that time, the regiment
numbered over 1000 men; but in consequence of laxity
in discipline of the first commanding officer, and other discouraging
obstacles connected with the acceptance of troops at
that time, but 603 were found willing to enter the three years’
service. In less than ten days Colonel Grant filled the regiment
to the maximum standard, and brought it to a state of
discipline seldom attained in the volunteer service in so short
a time.” Quincy, Illinois, was at this time supposed to be in
danger from attack by Missouri rebels, and an application
reached Governor Yates for a force sufficient for its protection.
The railroads were lacking in the necessary facilities for transportation,
and the Governor was sorely puzzled how to meet
the demand, when he received word from Colonel Grant saying,
“Send <em>my</em> regiment, and I will find the transportation.”
At once the order was given to send the 21st, and before night
it commenced the march on foot, accomplishing the whole distance
of 120 miles on foot (the only regiment that left the
camp of organization on foot), and arrived in good time and
excellent order. The duty to which the 21st, in company
with others, was assigned, was the protection of the Hannibal
and St. Louis Railroad, and it being necessary that a brigadier-general
should be assigned to the command of the regiments
employed upon this service, the choice fell upon Grant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a09'>a09</span>(although the youngest colonel on the ground), who took
command at Mexico, Missouri, upon the 31st of July, 1861,
being fully commissioned on the 9th of the following month.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brigadier-General Grant was now sent with a large force
into Southern Missouri, then threatened by the rebel general,
Jeff. Thompson. He superintended the erection of fortifications
at Ironton and Marble Creek, and having garrisoned
both places, hastened to the defense of Jefferson City, which
he protected from rebel attack for ten days. Thompson having
abandoned his purpose, Grant was next ordered to the command
of the important post of Cairo, Ill., which commanded
the Ohio and Upper Mississippi rivers, and was a depot of supplies
for an extensive region. This district included Western
Kentucky, whose citizens were at that time trying to remain
“on the fence,” until they could better see which side was to
succeed; and General Grant, learning that the rebels had
finally crossed the lines, and possessed themselves of Columbus
and Hickman, on the Mississippi, and Bowling Green, on the
Green River, promptly availed himself of the opportunity of
seizing positions within the State furnished by these violations
of Kentucky’s proposed neutrality, and quietly sent troops
(September 6) up the Ohio, to Paducah, at the mouth of the
Tennessee, and (on the 25th) to Smithland, at the mouth of
the Cumberland River—thus effectually closing two of the
principal avenues through which the rebels obtained supplies
of food, clothing, arms, etc., from the North. He next turned
his attention to Columbus, Ky., then held by the rebel Major-General
Polk, but was prevented from attacking him by the
withdrawal of a large portion of his force to St. Louis; and on
the 11th, learning that the rebel general, Jeff. Thompson, was
contemplating a raid through southwestern Missouri, he sent
an expedition which defeated and routed him near Dallas, on
the 21st of October. Then, being apprised of Jeff. Thompson’s
intention to blockade the Mississippi River, and move
upon his own position at Cairo, he determined to break up the
camp at Belmont, Mo., where the rebels were concentrating.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a10'>a10</span>At the head of two brigades, he moved down the Mississippi
in steamers. On the 6th of November they reached Belmont,
marched rapidly upon the enemy’s camp, two and a half miles
distant, forced their way over all obstructions, and surprised
the rebels, capturing camp equipage, artillery, small arms;
burning tents, blankets, etc., and capturing many prisoners.
On their return to the steamers, however, the victorious Union
army was met by about 4,000 rebel troops, who, under command
of Generals Polk, Pillow, and Cheatham, were hastening
to reinforce their comrades, and a fierce battle ensued.
The Union force, although losing some of the prisoners it had
taken, succeeded in reaching the river, and embarking again
in safety, under cover of gun-boats, bringing with them two
cannon which they had taken, and spiking two others, which
they were obliged to leave. The advantages of this fight, on
the whole, were with the Union troops, who also gained new
confidence in themselves, and in their commander.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant remained for some time in command of the
Cairo district (which was subsequently enlarged, so as to include
all the southern portion of Illinois, that part of Kentucky
west of the Cumberland River, and the southern counties
of Missouri), and performed a most important work in reorganizing,
training, and distributing to various posts, the
large number of newly mustered troops constantly sent into
his district. On the 14th of January, 1862, he made an extended
reconnoissance in force for the purpose of ascertaining
the rebel strength and position around Columbus; and in fact,
kept up such a feint of attack upon that point as led to large
concentration there of the rebel forces. Meanwhile a fleet of
gun-boats had been constructed above Cairo, manned and
placed under command of Flag-officer A. H. Foote. Then,
when all was ready, Grant secretly withdrew the two divisions
with which he had been threatening Columbus, and leaving
one to defend his base at Cairo, joined the other to two large
divisions, which had been concentrated at Paducah (at the
mouth of the Tennessee), and at Smithland (at the mouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a11'>a11</span>of the Cumberland). With these, he then moved on Fort
Henry, on the Tennessee; at which point, also, the gun-boats
arrived on the morning of February 6, in advance of the troops,
who had been delayed by the condition of the roads. The
fleet, however, attacked at once, and after a brief but spirited
engagement, the fort surrendered, the rebels outside making
their escape to Fort Donelson. Grant, whose plans had thus
been anticipated by the gallant Foote, now undertook the capture
of Fort Donelson, a larger and stronger work, garrisoned
by over 20,000 troops, and which still obstructed the passage
of the Cumberland River, and the advance of the Union army
southward. By the evening of the 12th, the fort was invested
on all but the river front, which was, however, covered on the
14th by the arrival of the gun-boats, and a combined land and
water attack was made, which, owing to damage done to the
boats, was unsuccessful. On the following morning, a sortie
by the rebel garrison broke the Union right and captured two
batteries. Rallying to their work, the Union troops recaptured
nearly all their guns, and then ensued a desperate, shifting,
uncertain, hand-to-hand fight, unfavorable on the whole
to the Union side. But the cool, calm judgment, and the indomitable
tenacity of Grant wrested victory from the very
jaws of defeat; and the desperate heroism of his men, inspired
by his example, secured for his army by nightfall, a position
which, it was evident, would give them the possession of the
fort on the morrow. Generals Floyd and Pillow escaped
during the night with a brigade of rebel troops, and Buckner,
who was left in command, sent to General Grant, at early
dawn on the following morning (16th), a proposition for an
armistice pending negotiations for surrender. To this Grant
sent his brief but famous reply: “<em>No other terms than unconditional
and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose
to move immediately upon your works.</em>” Finding parley useless,
the rebel General was obliged to surrender, which he did
rather ungraciously; and the fort, with 13,000 prisoners, 3,000
horses, 48 field-pieces, 17 heavy guns, 20,000 stand of arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a12'>a12</span>and a large quantity of stores, etc., fell into the possession of
the Union army; and on the following day, two rebel Tennesseean
regiments, uninformed of the surrender, marched into
the fort with colors flying, and were made prisoners. The
capture of Forts Henry and Donelson, rendered Columbus
and Bowling Green untenable by the rebel forces,—General
Polk retreating to Island No. 10, and Johnson to Nashville.
General Grant was now commissioned a Major-General of Volunteers,
dating from February 16, 1862; and March 5th was
assigned to the command of the new military district of West
Tennessee, bounded on the south by the Tennessee River
and the Mississippi State line, and on the west by the Mississippi
River, as far north as Cairo. From this district, Grant
now proposed to drive out the rebels, and he accordingly sent
gun-boats up the Cumberland, accompanied along the west
bank of the river by a division of troops. Clarksville, an important
base of supplies on the river, was captured soon after,
garrisoned, and held,—the gun-boats ascending the river
to open the way for General Buell’s army, then marching on
Nashville. After the fall of that place, they returned to the
Ohio, and reconnoitred the Tennessee River as far as Florence,
Alabama. Grant, who meanwhile had been engaged in reorganizing,
and sending forward troops and supplies, then moved
his head-quarters to Fort Henry, from whence he scoured the
country in all directions. Meanwhile General Albert Sydney
Johnston, who had been obliged to vacate Nashville, had concentrated
an army of 45,000 men, under able generals, at
Corinth, Miss., at the junction of the Mobile and Ohio and
Memphis and Charleston railroads. It was but twenty miles
from Pittsburg Landing and Shiloh, on the west bank of the
Tennessee, which had already been selected as a base of
operations for the Union forces; and General Buell’s army of
the Ohio was now <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> from Nashville to meet Grant’s command
there, with such haste as the roads permitted. Johnston
attempted to attack Grant’s army before Buell’s arrival, and
while Lew. Wallace’s division was yet at Crump’s Landing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a13'>a13</span>some six miles distance from the battle-field, hoping thus to
be able to conquer the Union forces in detail. At daybreak
of April 6, the blow suddenly fell upon Grant’s left (Prentiss’s
division), which, although surprised, fought bravely, but finally
gave way under the pressure, and were hurried as prisoners
to the rebel rear. Next the rebels massed upon W. H. L.
Wallace’s and Sherman’s divisions, and the former General
being mortally wounded, his troops were driven back. Sherman’s
force, however, held its position, and repulsed the enemy
in two several attacks. Meanwhile, other parts of the Union
line had been fiercely attacked by large bodies of rebel troops,
and had been gradually pressed back nearly two and a half
miles toward the Tennessee River. Sherman had by this
time taken a new position, which he held firmly against all
attack; and the scattered Union batteries, being collected by
General Webster (Grant’s chief of artillery), opened a steady
fire upon the rebels, who were attempting to flank the Union
left, with a view to possess themselves of the landing. This
fire, together with that of two gun-boats in the river, and the
news of the near approach of Buell’s advance, which had just
arrived across the river from the scene of action, checked the
rebels, and both armies rested on their arms until the following
morning. In the evening, Lew. Wallace’s division reached
the battle-field, and during the night, General Nelson’s division
of Buell’s army crossed the river; the remainder, however, did
not come over until the morning of the 7th. Assigning to the
centre the troops which had stood their ground on the previous
day, General Grant placed Wallace’s division on the right,
and Nelson’s on the left, and boldly attacked the rebel line.
The fighting, although not so heavy as on the preceding day,
was spirited, and the field was substantially won by the Union
troops by noon, at which time the remainder of Buell’s army
came up. By about 5 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. M.</span></span>, the rebels, defeated, routed, and
much demoralized, abandoned the field, and night fell upon
what had been thus far the most sanguinary contest of the
war. The Union loss, in killed, wounded, missing, and prisoners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a14'>a14</span>was 13,298; that of the rebels 10,699, with a remarkable
loss of general officers. The wearied troops spent the night
upon the battle-field, and pursuit was made on the 8th by
General Sherman, who destroyed the rebel camp and a large
amount of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 13th of April, General Halleck, with a powerful army,
composed of sixteen divisions under Generals Grant, Buell,
and Pope, advanced from Pittsburg Landing to the attack of
Corinth. On the 17th May, the Union army commenced a
series of regular approaches to the town, which Grant was
anxious to carry (as he was confident of his ability to do) by
assault. Halleck refused, and a quarrel ensued between the
two, the only one recorded in Grant’s military career. On
the night of the 28th, the rebels evacuated the closely invested
city, moving southward along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad,
to a safer position. New Orleans and Memphis had, meanwhile,
surrendered to the Union flag. On the 17th, General
Halleck was appointed General-in-Chief of the United States
armies, and Grant was assigned to the command of a newly
created department of West Tennessee, embracing Northern
Mississippi, West Tennessee, Western Kentucky, and Southern
Illinois. His head-quarters were at Memphis, which he
quickly cleared of the illicit traffic carried on by crafty secessionists,
gamblers, speculators, and smugglers. Grant now
determined to attempt the reduction of Vicksburg, the key to
the navigation of the Mississippi, strong by nature, and rendered
apparently impregnable by military science. Even
before its fortifications were completed, in the summer of 1862,
Admiral Farragut’s squadron had made no impression upon it;
and General Williams’s attempt to turn the current of the river
through a canal cut across the peninsula, formed by the bend
of the stream in front of the city, had proved a failure. After
full preparation for the enterprise, General Grant, in December,
began his movement down the Mississippi Central Railroad, in
order to flank Vicksburg, which was to be attacked at the
same time on the north and northwest, by Sherman descending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a15'>a15</span>the river from Memphis. His plans, however, were
deranged by the pusillanimity of the colonel commanding at
Holly Springs, where his chief depot of supplies was established,
and he was obliged to forego his expected junction with
Sherman. The latter general, unsupported by Grant, and
unaware of the cause of his failure, attacked Vicksburg; but
after three days’ hard fighting, was obliged to abandon the
assault. Grant next descended the Mississippi to Young’s
Point, a little above Vicksburg, and at first renewed the canal
project, which was rendered futile by a sudden flood in the
river; then he attempted an entrance to the Yazoo, by the
old Yazoo Pass, and afterwards by a circuit through Steel’s
and Black’s bayous, Duck and Deer creeks, and Rolling Fork
and Sunflower rivers. All these attempts failing to meet the
emergency, he determined—despite the numerous and apparently
insuperable difficulties which presented themselves—to
attack the fortress and city from below. Sending a part of
the gun-boat fleet, and sixteen or eighteen transports laden
with forage and supplies, past the batteries on two different
nights,—a most heroic act, which was accomplished with only
the loss of two transports,—General Grant marched his army
through the country west of the Mississippi to Hard Times,
La., a distance of seventy miles, over roads well-nigh impassable,
accomplishing the distance in thirty days. The gun-boats,
after an ineffectual attempt to capture Grand Gulf as a
base of operations, ran the batteries in the night, and on the
morning of March 30, commenced to ferry over the troops to
Bruinsburg, ten miles below. This was more easily effected,
inasmuch as a simultaneous demonstration by General Sherman
against Haines’s Bluff, attracted all their attention in that
direction. From Bruinsburg, Grant’s army moved rapidly to
Port Gibson, thus flanking Grand Gulf, which was evacuated
by the rebels, and immediately occupied by the Union forces
as a base of operations. Here, also, they were quickly joined
by General Sherman’s army, and, as had been previously arranged
by Grant, Colonel Grierson starting from Lagrange, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a16'>a16</span>the junction of the Mississippi Central with the Memphis and
Charleston railroads, and following the lines of the Mobile and
Ohio and Mississippi Central railroads, and the Meridian and
Jackson roads, reached Baton Rouge on the 1st of May,
having very thoroughly cut the rebel communications. Grant
now threw his army between Johnston and Pemberton, routed
the former, and drove the latter into Vicksburg, and by the
18th, had completely invested that city on the land side, and
was in communication with the squadron and transports by
way of Walnut Bluffs, above the river. On the 19th and
22d, assaults were made upon the city, but without decisive
results, and a regular siege was commenced, which, after a
prolonged and heroic resistance by the people and garrison,
resulted in its <em>unconditional</em> surrender on the 4th of July, 1863.
34,620 prisoners, 211 field-pieces, 90 siege guns, and 45,000
small arms fell into the hands of the victors; in addition to
which the rebels sustained a loss of 11,800 killed, wounded, or
deserters. The Union losses had been 8,575 killed, wounded,
and missing. Sending Sherman to Jackson, to defeat and
break up the rebel General Johnston’s army, Grant sought and
obtained a brief furlough—the first he had enjoyed during
the two and a quarter years he had been in the army—in order
to visit his family. Returning down the Mississippi—now,
thanks to his genius and skill, open to navigation for its whole
length—he visited General Banks at New Orleans, and while
there (September 4), was seriously injured by a fall from
his horse, so that it was not until November that he was able
to take an active part in military affairs. He was then given
the command of the Grand Military Division of the Mississippi,
comprising the armies of the Cumberland, the Tennessee, and
the Ohio, and promptly undertook the expulsion of the rebels
from the Chattanooga Valley, and the possession of Lookout
Mountain and Mission Ridge, from which points they were
enabled to impede all railroad and river communication with
Louisville and Nashville. The rebel General Bragg, who was
besieging Chattanooga, sent word, on the 21st of November,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a17'>a17</span>to General Grant, that “humanity would dictate the removal
of all non-combatants” from the city, as he was about to shell
it. Grant’s plans, however, had all been carefully laid, and
were now in course of execution, and the only reply to this
rebel braggart was in the shape of quick, hard blows. Burnside
was engaged in luring Longstreet’s force of 20,000 men,
which had been detached from the rebel army for operations
in East Tennessee, to such a distance as would render it impossible
for them to aid General Bragg when the final movement
should be made on him. Another force cut the railroads
leading to Knoxville; General Hooker, by a fine strategic
movement, seized Lookout Mountain; and Thomas, moving
out from Chattanooga, had obtained, with some hard fighting,
possession of Orchard Knob, and another hill in front of the
city, which commanded a part of Mission Ridge and the rebel
forts situated thereon. On the 25th, Grant ordered Sherman
to demonstrate strongly and persistently against Fort Buckner,
at the northern extremity of Mission Ridge, with a view of
drawing thither the greater part of the rebel troops in Forts
Breckinridge and Bragg, which would thus fall an easier prey
to a strong force sent to attack them in the rear. It is needless
to write the record of that battle; sufficient to say, that
the genius of Grant and his generals, and the wonderful heroism
of their men, overcame all obstacles, carried the rebel positions,
and drove Bragg’s routed army into the Valley of the
Chickamauga, pursuing them beyond Red Clay Station, on the
Dalton and Cleveland Railroad, which line of communication
was also most effectually destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Sherman, as directed by General Grant, reinforced
Burnside, and raised the siege of Knoxville (December 4),
forcing Longstreet to retreat to Virginia, closely pursued by
the Union cavalry. Four days later, Grant received from
President Lincoln the following despatch:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Washington</span>, <em>December 8, 1863</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Major-General Grant</span>,—Understanding that your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a18'>a18</span>lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now secure, I wish
to tender you, and all under your command, my more than
thanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and
perseverance with which you and they, over so great difficulties,
have effected that important object. God bless you all!</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='fss'>A. LINCOLN.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In addition to this, Congress, by joint resolution of December
17, 1863, tendered to General Grant the national thanks, and
provided for the preparation and presentation to him of a gold
medal, with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions. Resolutions
of thanks were also passed by the legislatures of most
of the loyal States; and the General became the recipient of
numerous, costly, and appropriate gifts from various public
bodies and private individuals. General Grant, meanwhile,
devoted himself assiduously to the repair and strengthening of
his army bases and lines of communication, the resting, equipment,
and recruiting of his brave soldiers, and the preparation
of the details connected with the coming campaign. He also
set on foot an expedition, under command of General Sherman,
which should leave Vicksburg, and at Meridian, Miss., should
be joined by a large cavalry force under General W. S. Smith,
the two then to traverse at will the central portions of Mississippi
and Alabama. This expedition, carefully planned, and
admirably carried out by Sherman, was shorn of its full
measure of success by the failure of the cavalry force to
coöperate with him at Meridian, yet it greatly crippled the
rebels, and seriously interfered with their movements.</p>

<p class='c000'>Congress having now revived the grade of <em>Lieutenant-General</em>,
which had been bestowed as an actual rank in time of
war only on General Washington (although given to General
Scott, by brevet), the honor was conferred by the President,
with the approval of the Senate, upon General Grant, on the
9th of March, 1864 (the commission bearing date of March
2), and General Sherman succeeded to the command of the
Military Division of the Mississippi, while McPherson took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a19'>a19</span>Sherman’s place with the army of the Tennessee, and General
Halleck, hitherto General-in-chief, was made Chief of Staff
at Washington.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new Lieutenant-General, who had in January, 1864,
visited and carefully inspected the Military Division of the
Mississippi, now spent a few weeks in a similar examination
of the other western departments, and in arranging with
General Sherman the details of the coming spring and summer
campaign. Having done this, and made such arrangements
as should insure the simultaneous and coöperative
movements of the Union armies in the West and East, so as
to prevent the reinforcement of one rebel army by the other,
as had frequently been the case during the previous campaigns,
he assumed the command in person of the Eastern armies
designed to assail Richmond. The forces with which he
proposed to reduce the Confederate capital consisted of the
army of the Potomac, under General Meade, and numbering
nearly 130,000 men, besides Sheridan’s splendid cavalry corps,
and a reserve of nearly 40,000 men, of which one third were
colored troops; the army of the James, under Major-General
Butler, composed partly of the former army of Eastern Virginia
and North Carolina, and partly of Gilmore’s fine corps
of colored troops; and to these were soon after added the army
of the Shenandoah, composed of the army of Western Virginia,
and a large cavalry force, all under command of General
Sigel. The great rebel army, under General R. E. Lee, lay
south of the Rapidan, with its left near Gordonsville, and its
right near Chancellorsville. Opposite to this, and north of
the Rapidan, was the army of the Potomac, extending from
Brandy Station to Robertson’s River, with its head-quarters
at Culpepper Court-house. Confronting the rebel hosts, as it
had done for months previous, it awaited the signal to strike
the first blow in the final struggle. To the army of the James
was assigned the duty of seizing, by a neat stratagem, the
position of Bermuda Hundred, located on the right or south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a20'>a20</span>side of the James, midway between Richmond and Petersburg;
and the interposition, if possible, of a sufficient force to
cut the communications between those two cities, and insure
the capture of the latter. The army of the Shenandoah was
expected, by a movement on Staunton, Lynchburg, and
Waynesboro’, to cripple Lee, by cutting off his supplies from
the west, and also to protect Maryland and Pennsylvania
from any rebel movement through the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all was ready, the army of the Potomac made its
first move on the morning of the 4th of May, 1864, crossed
the Rapidan, with a view to flank Lee’s right, then intrenched
at Mine Run. Lee, however, was on his guard, and the Union
army, plunging almost immediately on crossing into a large
tract of dense and tangled forest near Chancellorsville, called
“The Wilderness,” found themselves attacked, before they
could get into position, by a heavy rebel force under Longstreet.
The battle was fierce, and lasted into the night, but
without any decisive result. At four o’clock on the following
morning, the rebels renewed the assault, with very heavy
attacking columns, and the battle raged fiercely, until about
dark, they succeeded in completely flanking the Union right.
Grant, however, skillfully extended his left and centre, and
brought his right into a new position, by which maneuver his
base was changed to Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock.
By this move he flanked Lee in turn, and secured for himself
a more open country, in which to use his artillery. Lee fell
back, and the Union advance overtook him May 7, strongly
posted at Spottsylvania Court-house. Sharp fighting ensued
on the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th, but with no decisive result.
On the night of the 11th, Grant transferred Hancock’s corps
to the left, and at half-past four o’clock of the following
morning, it surprised the enemy’s right with a terrible bayonet
charge, which was a complete victory, capturing 30 heavy
guns, and over 4,000 prisoners, including two generals. Other
Union successes in other parts of the field, also called out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a21'>a21</span>most determined resistance from the rebels, who endeavored,
in vain, to recapture the positions they had lost. Lee’s lines,
on the 14th, were reformed, and moved further to the right,
and from the 12th to the 18th of May both armies rested, and
were each largely reinforced. On the 18th, General Hancock
charged, and gained two intrenchments on the rebel right;
and Grant, during the three following days, successfully accomplished
another flanking movement to Milford Bridge, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i>
Guiney’s Station. Lee, at the same time, took up a new and
strong position between the North and South Anna. Some
hard fighting which ensued, convinced General Grant that another
flank movement was the best course to be adopted, and
directing the army to recross the North Anna, under cover of
an attack by his right wing, he burned the Virginia Central
Railroad Bridge, rapidly crossed the Pamunkey, and on the
31st of May was within fifteen miles of Richmond. Here Lee
was again ready to meet him, and much desultory fighting ensued,
but no general engagement. On June 1, the 6th Corps
approached Cold Harbor, and being joined by a force from the
army of the James, fought a stubborn battle on the 3d, which
gave them the full possession of that place. A subsequent
attack the same day, upon the rebel works, convinced Grant
that a direct attack would involve too great a loss of life, and
between the 12th and 15th June, he boldly recrossed the
James in the face of the enemy, although without his knowledge,
and prepared to attack Richmond from that side.
General Butler, meanwhile, had seized and occupied Bermuda
Hundred; cut the railroad below Petersburg; made a bold,
but unsuccessful dash upon the city; had besieged Fort Darling,
but was unable to hold his position; had repulsed several
rebel attacks upon his own lines, and was now awaiting support
from the approaching army of the Potomac. Sigel had
not been very fortunate in effecting his share of the programme,—having
been roughly handled by the rebels in the
Shenandoah Valley: he was relieved in command by General
Hunter, who at first defeated the rebels handsomely near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a22'>a22</span>Staunton; but was, in turn, obliged to retreat by Early, and
suffered terribly in a forced march into Western Virginia.
During the time occupied in these changes, Sheridan had
“raided” completely around Lee’s lines, penetrating within
the first line of Lee’s communications, destroying railroads
and depots of supplies, capturing rebels, and releasing many
Union prisoners. The rebel General Early, having rid himself
of Sigel and Hunter, passed down the Valley of the Shenandoah,
crossed into Maryland, occupied Hagerstown and
Frederick, plundered and foraged, fought the militia, whom
he encountered, and threatened Baltimore and Washington,
approaching to within two miles of the latter city. Finding,
however, most unexpectedly, that veteran troops from
New Orleans and the army of the Potomac had arrived, and
were now garrisoned there, and that General Couch was approaching
his rear from Pennsylvania, he decamped again into
Virginia, well laden with plunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grant, upon reaching the south side of the James, ordered
an attack upon Petersburg, which failed of success in consequence
of the want of proper coöperation on the part of the
cavalry. A series of attacks upon the rebel works ensued,
and the city was fairly invested by the 22d of June, except on
its northern and western side. On that day, also, the Union
troops, by dint of hard fighting, secured possession of the South
Side (Petersburg and Danville) Railroad, while Wilson’s and
Kautz’s cavalry attacked and destroyed a considerable section
of the Weldon Railroad, and a large amount of stores; but
were surrounded by a large rebel force before they could
regain the Union lines, and lost seven or eight hundred men.
An interval of comparative quiet succeeded these movements,
during which an extensive mine was run under one of the
enemy’s forts, and in order to divert the attention of General
Lee’s force, at the time for its explosion General Grant ordered
a feint to be made north of the James, against their left. This
attack, known as the action of Strawberry Plains, was entirely
successful; the rebel left was turned, and four heavy guns were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a23'>a23</span>captured. On the 30th of July, the mine, containing eight
tons of powder, was exploded, and under cover of a terrific
cannonade along the whole length of the Union lines, an
assault was made upon Petersburg. Fatal delays and misunderstandings,
at the critical moment, gave the enemy time to
recover somewhat from the surprise of the explosions, and
their courageous defense foiled the Union attack, which resulted
disastrously, especially to the colored troops engaged in
it. On the 12th of August, the 2d Corps fought the battle
of Deep Bottom, north of the James, with a loss to the rebels
of their position, 500 prisoners, 6 cannon and 2 mortars. On
the 18th, the Weldon Railroad, at Reams’ Station, was surprised,
and occupied by the 5th Corps, which, in turn, was
heavily attacked on the 19th by the rebel troops, and fell
back; but being reinforced by the 9th Corps, succeeded in
partly retrieving their position, but with a loss of nearly 4,000
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>For five weeks following, although a little advance had
gradually been gained by the Union forces, no battle of importance
ensued. On the night of September 28, General Ord
crossed to the north side of the James, and on the following
morning carried the rebel intrenchments at Chaffin’s Farms,
without serious loss, capturing 15 pieces of artillery and some
300 prisoners. Simultaneously, General Birney carried the
intrenchments on the Newmarket road, and the Union forces,
having occupied Fort Harrison, advanced to Laurel Hill. The
Confederates next made a desperate attempt to retake Fort
Harrison, on the 30th, but were repulsed. On the 1st of
October, the Union cavalry reconnoitred to within two miles
of the Confederate capital; and on the 7th, the army of the
James repulsed a sharp attempt of the rebels to turn its right
flank, with a severe loss to the assailants. On the 29th, a reconnoissance
in force was made against the rebel position at
Hatcher’s Run, which resulted in a severe battle, with great
loss to the Union troops; who, however, held the position
until withdrawn by General Grant. The inefficiency of commanders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a24'>a24</span>which up to this time had existed in the Shenandoah
Valley and Northern Virginia and Maryland, led in
August, 1864, to the organization of a new and larger department,
known as the Department of the Shenandoah, to the
command of which, by General Grant’s desire, General Philip
H. Sheridan was assigned. The new commander soon justified
the confidence of his chief; on the 19th of September, he defeated
and routed Early’s army at Opequan Creek, taking over
2000 prisoners, and a large number of guns; on the 22d, he
routed them again at Fisher’s Hill, and pursued them to
Staunton; and on the 9th of October, he repulsed General
Rosser again at Fisher’s Hill, thrashing him soundly. On the
19th of the same month, while Sheridan was absent at Washington,
his army was attacked by Early, defeated and driven
back three miles, with the loss of twenty-four cannon; but
Sheridan, returning to the front met his routed men, rallied
them, and swept back with them over the field, whipping the
rebels, sending them, “man and horse,” “whirling through
the Valley,” and capturing fifty-two pieces of artillery, including
all those which his men had lost in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman, also, had been “cutting a wide swath” in the enemy’s
country. A campaign of remarkable energy and hard fighting
had given him the possession of Atlanta, Georgia, on the
2d of September; then leaving General Thomas to watch and
manage the rebel Hood in Alabama, he had cut loose from his
base at Atlanta and marched through the heart of rebeldom, 300
miles, to Savannah, which surrendered to him on the 22d of December.
Hood, meanwhile, led on by Thomas’ maneuvers of
retreat, and by his own rashness, fell into the trap prepared for
him and which “sprung” upon him at Franklin, on the 30th of
November, in a battle which cost him the loss of eighteen generals
and nearly 7,000 troops. Still persisting in an attempt to
invest Nashville, he was attacked by General Thomas, on the
15th of December, routed and driven in confusion to the Tennessee
River and out of the State. During the same month, an
expedition planned by General Grant, consisting of two divisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a25'>a25</span>under General Butler, and a naval force under Rear
Admiral Porter, set sail (December 15) against Fort Fisher,
N. C. This was unsuccessful, and was speedily followed by a
second expedition, in which the command of the land forces
was given to General Terry. This proved a grand success,
capturing Fort Fisher, (January 15,) and effectually closing
Wilmington harbor, which had long been one of the chief
channels of foreign supplies to the Confederacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th of February, a movement upon Hatcher’s Run,
ordered by General Grant for the purpose of gaining position
nearer to the Weldon Railroad, resulted in a desperate struggle,
in which (on the second day) the Union lines were broken,
but the next day the lost ground was regained and held, and
finally the lines were permanently advanced four miles in advance
of the original position. On the 25th of March, 1865,
the rebels suddenly massed a heavy force upon Fort Steadman,
near Petersburg, which they captured, but were almost
immediately repulsed, and a portion of their own lines held by
the 6th and 2d Corps. Four days later (29th) General Grant
ordered an advance in order to occupy the Southside Railroad,
which was now Lee’s only line of supplies. Sending Sheridan,
who with his cavalry had just cut the rebel lines of communication
north of Richmond, to threaten the railroad near
Burkesville Junction, in order to attract Lee’s attention in that
direction, he moved the 2d and 5th Corps across Hatcher’s Run
(by the Vaughan and Halifax roads) to endeavor to seize the
Boydton plank-road. On the first day, all went well; the cavalry
reached Dinwiddie; the 5th Corps had a sharp but successful
fight for the possession of the Quaker road, and the 2d
Corps encountered but little opposition. By the 30th of March,
the 5th and 2d Corps held the White Oak road and the
Boydton plank-road; but the next day, the 5th, in attempting
to reach Five Forks, on the White Oak road, found the
enemy strongly intrenched, and was driven back upon the 2d
Corps. Rallying, and with the help of a division of the 2d
Corps, they regained their previous position by nightfall, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a26'>a26</span>only by very hard fighting. Meanwhile Sheridan’s cavalry
had been fiercely attacked by another rebel division, but the
gallant general dismounted his men, placed them behind temporary
breastworks, and repulsed the enemy until nightfall—both
sides resting on their arms during the night, within a
short distance of each other. Sheridan expected the reinforcement
of Warren’s 5th Corps, which Grant had notified him
would report to him that night, and he dispatched a note to
Warren at 3 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. M.</span></span>, urging his speedy approach, on the enemy’s
rear, while he would attack them in front. Warren, however,
did not reply till morning, and did not succeed in reaching
Dinwiddie; and Sheridan, promptly at the time appointed,
attacked the foe with his own troops, driving them west of
Chamberlain’s Creek. Meeting Warren, about seven or
eight o’clock, four or five miles north of Dinwiddie, he directed
him to press on the enemy when he should receive
orders, and himself invested Five Forks, on two sides, with his
cavalry. A little after noon he ordered Warren to attack
on the east side, but Warren’s movements seemed to him so
reluctant and indifferent that, although the attack proved
a perfect success, Sheridan relieved the general from his
command, which was given to General Griffin. On the following
day the enemy were pushed still farther to the river
road on the banks of the Appomattox.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fierce bombardment continued along the Union lines
surrounding Petersburg, and on the 2d of April, the 6th, 9th,
and the Provisional Corps, after a short but terrible struggle,
seized and tore up the long coveted Southside Railroad, capturing
many prisoners and guns. Richmond and Petersburg,
being thus rendered untenable, were evacuated during the
same night, and occupied by Union troops on the morning of
April 3, 1865. Pausing not for a moment, however, General
Grant pressed on in the hopes of capturing the defeated rebel
general and his army. At Deep Creek, Paine’s Cross-roads,
Deatonsville, Farmville, High Bridge over the Appomattox,
and Appomattox Station, actions of greater or less severity were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a27'>a27</span>fought with the rebel army, which now, thoroughly demoralized,
was strewing the road with deserted artillery, wagons,
and supplies, which were passed unnoticed and untouched by
the Union troops in the heat of their unremitting and exultant
pursuit. At length, on the 7th, General Grant at Farmville,
sent a note to Lee, requesting the surrender of the Confederate
Army of Northern Virginia. Pressing on, still in relentless
pursuit, he was met at Appomattox Station, on the morning
of the 9th, by a note from General Lee asking for an interview
with a view to the surrender of his command. The same
afternoon, at Appomattox Court-house, he received the surrender
of the rebel chieftain, on terms which were liberal in
the extreme. The war was now virtually ended, and Grant,
passing through Richmond, went to Washington, and on the
14th took the cars for a visit to his family, then in New Jersey,
but was overtaken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> by the terrible news of the
assassination of President Lincoln, and the tragic events caused
by a plot, of which it seems that he had been one of the
marked victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, Sherman sweeping through the Carolinas, had
flanked and captured Charleston, S. C., as well as Columbia,
Cheraw, Fayetteville, and with the aid of Generals Terry and
Schofield, had taken Goldsboro’, Smithfield, and Raleigh, and
held Johnston’s rebel army “pinned to the wall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stoneman’s cavalry from Thomas’ army, had also thoroughly
broken the Virginia and East Tennessee Railroad and the
North Carolina road above Salisbury, had released the Union
prisoners confined there, captured a large amount of stores,
and effectually cut off Johnston’s retreat. From south, west,
and southwest came cheering news of victories won, all tending
to the completion of the great plan by which the power
of treason was to be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this juncture, the Cabinet at Washington received from
General Sherman a memorandum of a treaty between himself
and General Johnston, for the surrender of all the rebel armies
in the field and the complete cessation of hostilities. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a28'>a28</span>then excited state of public feeling, the terms accorded by General
Sherman to the rebel leaders, were deemed too liberal;
and at the request of the Government, General Grant proceeded
<em>incognito</em> to Raleigh, conferred with Sherman, and ordered
the immediate resumption of hostilities. This brought Johnston
to terms, and, by General Grant’s orders, General Sherman
received his surrender, on the 26th of April, on the
same terms as those accorded to General Lee. The surrender
of Dick Taylor to General Canby on the 4th of May, 1865,
and shortly after, of Kirby Smith’s army west of the Mississippi,
completed the record of the War of the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant returned to Washington, where on the 28th,
he issued an order reducing the expenses of the Military Department,
and attended the grand review of his victorious
legions at Washington, preparatory to their disbanding and
return to their homes. Visiting his family at Burlington,
N. J., on the 2d of May, he was, on the 3d, welcomed by the
citizens of Philadelphia, who presented him with a costly and
elegantly furnished house in that city. A portion of the
summer of 1865 was spent by him in flying trips to the East
and West and Canadas; and his passage through the country
was a series of brilliant receptions, orations, and public and
private demonstrations of respect, which proved the people
not unmindful of the distinguished services he had rendered
to the Republic. At Galena, the place of his residence when
he entered the service, the citizens met him with festive
demonstrations of affection and respect, and presented him
with an elegant and well-furnished house (costing $16,000),
on a most beautiful elevation near the city, which he and his
family entered amidst the cheers of the excited crowd, and the
ringing of all the church-bells in the place. On the 10th of
November, he was complimented by the City of New York,
with a magnificent banquet and reception at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, rarely equalled even in that demonstrative metropolis,
and presented by the merchants and capitalists of the
city with one hundred thousand dollars, as a token of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a29'>a29</span>gratitude for his patriotic and successful labors in restoring
union and peace to the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Thirty-Ninth Congress at its first session, resolved to
create the rank of <em>General</em> of the army, which had hitherto
been considered the special perquisite and prerogative of the
President, and Lieutenant General Grant was promoted to
this honor, which it was resolved by Congress, when again
vacant, should not be filled. His commission as General bears
date July 25, 1866, and on the same day, Major-General
Sherman was promoted to the vacant Lieutenant Generalship.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant, by special order of President Johnson, accompanied
him in his tour in the summer of 1866, to Chicago
and St. Louis; but during the whole journey he neither
by word or look manifested, as he doubtless did not feel, any
sympathy with Mr. Johnson’s “policy” of reconstruction.
In the correspondence relative to the New Orleans massacre,
he manifested his abhorrence of the act, though he knew that
it had received the quasi-sanction of the President. With his
habitual reticence, he refrained from any interference with, or
expression of opinion upon, political questions; and though
urged as a candidate for the Presidency at first by conservative
Republicans and some Democrats, he manifested no interest
in the movement, and the most skillful pumping failed to
elicit from him any expression of opinion which the politicians
could make available. His duties as General of the army
were performed quietly, promptly, and satisfactorily, and the
hospitalities of his house in Washington were freely tendered
to men of all parties and of none.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time came, however, when this reticence could no
longer be maintained. The President, who had long been
cherishing hostility toward the Secretary of War, Hon.
Edwin M. Stanton, early in August, 1867, requested him to
resign; Mr. Stanton refused to do so, on the plea that he
was compelled to retain office from his view of what were the
exigencies of the public service, and President Johnson immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a30'>a30</span>suspended him from office, and appointed General
Grant Secretary, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span></i>, on the 12th of August, 1867.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Stanton surrendered the office to General Grant under
protest, though it was well understood, without any hostile
feeling toward him personally. General Grant managed the
affairs of the Department wisely and well, reducing expenses,
and infusing a somewhat greater zeal and activity into the public
service. On the reassembling of Congress in November,
1867, a demand was made by the Senate upon the President
for an account of the circumstances attending the suspension
of Secretary Stanton, and having received them, after a very
full discussion, they decided them insufficient, and that Secretary
Stanton must be reinstated. On the passage of this
resolution by the Senate, General Grant promptly relinquished
his position to Mr. Stanton, having notified the President that
he should do so. The President, greatly enraged at having his
purpose foiled, of putting a man into the place who would
sympathize with him, commenced an angry correspondence
with the General, and attempted to fasten upon him the
charges of treachery and want of veracity, claiming that he
had promised to give him due notice of his intention to surrender
the office, that he might put some one else in his place, or
to hold the position himself when Stanton should demand it.
General Grant replied with a frank and soldier-like statement
of the facts, to which the President rejoined somewhat abusively,
and adduced letters from members of his Cabinet for
the purpose of sustaining his statements. Some of these letters
failed most signally to accomplish the object for which
they were intended, while others were evidently a mere compliance
with the President’s request that they should sustain
his statements. General Grant replied again, more briefly
than before, but clearing himself handsomely from the charge
of insubordination, which the President had sought to fix
upon him. There was probably some misunderstanding of
General Grant’s language on the part of the President in
the first place, as the General, before examining the subject,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a31'>a31</span>had expressed the opinion to the President that Secretary
Stanton would have to apply to the courts to be reinstated,
but had subsequently, on careful examination, changed his
opinion, and so informed the President. As the result of his
refusing to surrender the office would have been a fine of ten
thousand dollars and five years’ imprisonment, there is no
probability that he made the promise to retain the position,
notwithstanding the President’s very liberal but totally impracticable
offer, to take the punishment upon himself. With
the views he entertained, when he discovered the President’s
purpose of putting a man into the office who would carry out
his views of reconstruction, it is equally incredible that he
should have promised to give the President the opportunity of
accomplishing his purpose and thwarting the congressional
plan of reconstruction, the success of which he had much at
heart. Aside from this, the issue in a question of veracity
between Ulysses S. Grant and Andrew Johnson could not
fail to be decided in favor of the former, whose sturdy truthfulness
has been as conspicuous as Johnson’s shuffling self-contradiction,
and general unveracity.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant is now by common consent the candidate of
the Republican party for the Presidency, and seems to have
the prospect of an election almost by acclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In person he is short, about five feet eight (the height if we
recollect aright of the “Little Corporal,” and like him somewhat
inclined to stoutness). He has a clear, well-balanced
brain, with no faculty in excess and none deficient. He is not
a genius, but a man of fair talents, with a thorough insight into
character, and a remarkable faculty of always putting “the
right man in the right place.” Despite the reports of his being
addicted to intoxication, we have the highest authority for saying,
that he is not only not a drunkard, but a man of remarkable
temperance, abstaining from the use even of wine, when
most men would consider themselves bound in courtesy to
drink it. He does smoke excessively, being seldom seen without
a cigar in his mouth, but his smoking is quiet and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a32'>a32</span>spiteful, like that of General Sherman. He is a skillful billiard-player,
and retains his old fondness for horses. He is one of
the best equestrians in the country, and, like Phil. Sheridan,
appears to extraordinary advantage in the saddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the rest, he is not ambitious; is reticent in the extreme
on all political questions, but evidently not from ignorance of
them. He possesses great vitality, and a pertinacity and perseverance
in completing what he undertakes, which on the
right side (and he will be generally found there) is invaluable.
His seven years of command have been a valuable discipline
to him, and his views have been widened and deepened
thereby. He is thoroughly honest, and will be as careful of
the people’s money as of his own; yet his views of economy
are not of the scrimping, miserly sort. He only desires that
money shall be rightly, judiciously, and prudently expended,
and not squandered for the benefit of office-holders. While
we do not regard him as the greatest of men, we believe if
his life is spared he will make one of the best of Presidents.</p>

<p class='c013'>In formally accepting the nomination of the National Union Republican Convention
of the 21st of May inst. it seems proper that some statement of views beyond
the mere acceptance of the nomination should be expressed. The proceedings
of the Convention were marked with wisdom, moderation, and patriotism,
and I believe express the feelings of the great mass of those who sustained the
country through its recent trials. I endorse the resolutions. If elected to the
office of President of the United States, it will be my endeavor to administer all
the laws in good faith, with economy, and with the view of giving peace, quiet,
and protection everywhere. In times like the present it is impossible, or at least
eminently improper, to lay down a policy to be adhered to, right or wrong,
through an administration of four years. New political issues, not foreseen, are
constantly arising; the views of the public on old ones are constantly changing,
and a purely administrative officer should always be left free to execute the will
of the people. I always have respected that will, and always shall. Peace and
universal prosperity—its sequence—with economy of administration will lighten
the burden of taxation, while it constantly reduces the National debt. Let us
have peace. With great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>Schuyler Colfax</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_a33'>a33</span>
  <h3 class='c020'>HON. SCHUYLER COLFAX.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c031'>The universal popularity of Mr. Colfax, and the thorough
confidence felt by all classes in his integrity, intellectual ability
and capacity to fill the highest position in the gift of the
nation, should he be called to it, are among the most remarkable
circumstances of his life-history. He is not a military
hero. His fame, wide-spread as it is, was not won on the
tented field, nor in the fierce strife and din of battle. His
triumphs have been of a more peaceful character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though of a good and honorable lineage, he owes nothing
to the accident of birth or hereditary fortune, and though a
man of cultivated intellect and extensive general knowledge,
he has not the eclat of honors won in college or university to
make him conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still less is his fame dependent on exalted political station,
long and ably held. He has been indeed a representative of
the people in Congress, and for five years past Speaker of the
House of Representatives, and his abilities have been fairly
and fully proved in both capacities, but other men have presided
over the House of Representatives, and been for years
members of that body, or of the Senate, and yet no one has
thought of them for the Vice-Presidency, or the Presidency.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whence then comes this universal esteem in which this
man is held; this almost brotherly attachment which leads
all who know him personally, and tens of thousands who do
not, to speak of him, not as <em>Mr.</em> Colfax, but as Schuyler Colfax,
just as men used to say Abraham, or “Abe” Lincoln,
and not coldly, <em>Mr.</em> Lincoln?</p>

<p class='c000'>We propose to answer this question by a brief sketch of his
life, which will we think, give us the best key to this personal
magnetism which draws all men to him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a34'>a34</span>In 1822, there lived in North Moore Street, then a quiet, home-like
street running westward from West Broadway, New York,
a young couple by the name of Colfax. The husband, named
like his illustrious son, Schuyler Colfax, was a bank clerk.
The child-wife, for she was then but little more than fifteen
years of age, looked up confidingly and tenderly to the brave,
noble-hearted young man on whom she had bestowed her
heart’s affections, and both anticipated a long and joyous
future. But ere the new year of 1823 dawned, that young
husband was taken from life, and the girl-wife was a widow.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early spring, (on the 23d of March, 1823), a son,
destined to cheer and comfort her in her subsequent earthly
pilgrimage was given her, and though poor and widowed, the
young mother felt that she was not alone. The boy grew
up, a slender, delicate, bright, loving boy, flaxen-haired, and
seemingly too frail to struggle with the rough world with
which he was brought in contact; but though poverty pressed
hard upon mother and child, they were all in all to each
other. The boy attended the school of the Public School
Society, for in those days, Ward Schools were undreamed of,
till he had reached his tenth year, and made good proficiency,
being always, as one of his schoolmates testifies, at the head
of his class. When he was ten years old his mother married
again, and this time a merchant by the name of Matthews,
who was very fond of Schuyler, and in whose store he became
thus early, a younger clerk. In 1836, the fever for emigration,
then so prevalent, seized the Matthews family, and they
removed to what is now the garden of the west, the valley of
the St. Joseph’s river, in Indiana. It was then, much of it,
an unbroken wilderness, though South Bend and two or three
other villages were beginning to attract emigrants. In one
of these villages, New Carlisle, the family made their new
home, and Mr. Matthews engaged in trade. Schuyler Colfax
was for four years more his clerk. In 1840, Mr. Matthews
was chosen Auditor of St. Joseph’s County, and for convenience
in his official duties, removed to South Bend, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a35'>a35</span>county seat, which has ever since been the home of the family.
Mr. Matthews made his step-son deputy auditor, and the boy,
who had diligently improved every leisure moment in study,
now a tall, flaxen-haired youth, soon became so thoroughly
familiar with the law in all questions relating to the auditor’s
duties, that he was ere long the standard authority for the
region about, on these subjects. But his reading of law at
this time was not confined to that required for exercising an
auditor’s duties; he found time to make himself master of
its great principles, rather however for the sake of the general
culture it would afford him, than with the view of adopting
it as a profession. During this period too he was practicing
himself in that facility for putting his thoughts on paper
which was afterwards of so much advantage to him. A gentleman,
well known in the philanthropic circles of New York
and Brooklyn, who had been a schoolmate of Mr. Colfax in
that Crosby Street School, which was the last one he attended
in New York city, kept up a correspondence with him during
these years of his service as deputy auditor, and says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Schuyler’s letters in those days were very interesting;
they were filled with details concerning his studies, knotty
questions which he wanted me to aid him in clearing up, and
brilliant thoughts, often expressed with the same felicity
which now marks his writings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To such a youth, writing for the newspapers was almost a
necessity. There had been a paper in South Bend edited for
some years by John D. Defrees, since then a Member of Congress
and Government printer. To its columns Schuyler contributed
often, and he was but little more than twenty-one
years of age, when he became editor and proprietor of the
<cite>St. Joseph’s Valley Register</cite>, his friend Defrees having removed
to Indianapolis to take charge of the <cite>State Journal</cite>. Previous
to this, however, he and Mr. Defrees, with some other enterprising
young men of South Bend, had organized a debating
society, and by a happy thought had modeled it after the
House of Representatives, whose rules they adopted for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a36'>a36</span>governance. Mr. Defrees was for the time the “Speaker” of
this Village House of Representatives, and Colfax, yet a youth
under age, was “the gentleman from Newton.” Parliamentary
rules were insisted upon, and the pages of Jefferson’s and
Cushing’s Manuals were carefully and thoroughly conned, till
“the gentleman from Newton” became as conversant with the
rules and usage of “the House,” as any presiding officer in
our State legislatures. This, and the habit of off hand debate,
were of great advantage to him in after years, and contributed
much to make him, as he is acknowledged to be, by all
parties, the best presiding officer the House of Representatives
has had for many years.</p>

<p class='c000'>He entered upon the work of editing and managing the
<cite>St. Joseph’s Valley Register</cite> with but two hundred and fifty
subscribers. It was a small sheet, and for some years, it
required all his exertions, often protracted far into the
night, to make it pay. He had not been bred a printer,
but in these years he learned enough of the art to be able to
render material service in setting up the paper. His friend
Defrees, who knew his abilities, secured his services for two
successive sessions of the legislature as Senate Reporter for
the <cite>State Journal</cite>, and this helped him to relieve himself of the
burden of debt, which for a time threatened to crush him.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the first, he made the <em>Register</em> a good paper. He
was a Whig and his sympathies were with his party, and he
ably defended its principles; but though often attacked personally
and with scurrilous abuse by the Democratic papers
of that section, he never allowed a discourteous or abusive
word in his paper. He was too thoroughly a gentleman in
word and thought and nature to stoop to scurrility, and his
opponents soon found that they injured themselves in their
efforts to injure him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In South Bend every body liked him and believed in him;
the magnetism of his genial face, his kindly nature, and his
cordial hand-grasp won all hearts. He was, the villagers said,
a remarkable man, especially for a newspaper editor; he paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a37'>a37</span>his debts; he drank no whiskey; he was prudent and economical;
he never uttered an oath; and though it was only by
careful management that he avoided debt, he always seemed
to have something to give to the poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was, during this period, steadily gaining reputation as a
political writer and speaker. In 1848, he was chosen as a
delegate to the convention which nominated General Taylor
for the Presidency, and on taking his seat in the convention,
was elected its principal secretary. In 1850, he represented
St. Joseph’s County in the convention which formed the present
constitution of Indiana. In that convention he opposed with
all his ability, the adoption of the clause preventing free
colored men from settling in the State. The next year he
was nominated by his district for Congress, and had for a
competitor Dr. Graham N. Fitch, an old, wily, and experienced
Democratic politician, subsequently the colleague of
Jesse D. Bright, as Senator, and in a district which for years
had been Democratic by some thousands majority. Dr. Fitch
used his opposition to the black laws, mercilessly, against
him, but defeated him by only two hundred and thirty-eight
votes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1852, Mr. Colfax was again a delegate to and secretary
of the National Convention which nominated General Scott
for the Presidency. In the spring of 1858, he was urged to
accept another nomination for Congress, but declined, and
Dr. Fitch was re-elected by a majority of more than a thousand
votes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the era of the Kansas-Nebraska swindle, and though
the district which he represented was strongly opposed to this
measure, and his constituents used all their influence to dissuade
him from supporting it, yet Dr. Fitch was so mole-eyed,
and so wedded to slavery, that he advocated and voted
for it steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was too much for the good people of St. Joseph county;
a majority of them had voted the Democratic ticket regularly,
but they were determined to do so no longer. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a38'>a38</span>young editor of the <cite>St. Joseph’s Valley Register</cite> was urged to
accept the nomination for Congress, and was elected in 1854,
a representative in the XXXIVth Congress, by seventeen
hundred and sixty-six majority. This result was due in part
to the great reaction, but it was aided by the efforts of Mr.
Colfax, who took the stump, and discussed with his competitor,
through the district, the political questions of the canvass with
such ability and spirit as to carry all hearts with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He entered Congress at the time of the protracted struggle
in regard to the election of a Speaker, which terminated in
the choice of Nathaniel P. Banks, and he gallantly plunged
into the contest. His maiden speech took the whole House
by surprise. It not only demonstrated that he was even then
one of the ablest debaters in the House, but its eloquence,
its logical power, and its graphic portrayal of the real condition
of Kansas, and of the iniquity of the Border-Ruffian
movement, made it the most effective campaign document of
the season, and of the Presidential conflict of that year.
Over five hundred thousand copies of that speech were printed
and circulated by the National Committee—a compliment we
believe never before paid to any member of Congress, certainly
not to the maiden speech of one of the youngest members
of the House.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the Presidential contest of 1856, the first of the Republican
party, Mr. Colfax entered with all his zeal and enthusiasm.
The banner of Fremont and Dayton was borne
aloft in his paper, and his eloquent appeals in its behalf rang
through all the States of the West. Victory was perhaps
hardly to be expected for a new party at its first trial, but
never was a fight more gallantly conducted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people of northern Indiana knew and honored the talents
and worth of their Representative. By that personal
magnetism which he possesses, in larger measure than most
men, he had drawn all hearts to him, and they have kept him
in Congress from 1855 to the present time, and always by
large majorities. In 1860 he received thirty-four hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a39'>a39</span>more votes than his competitor, and in 1866 nearly twenty-two
hundred more.</p>

<p class='c000'>His great power as a debater, his strong, clear common
sense, quick intuition, and devotion to the best interests of
his country, made him a very valuable member of the House
of Representatives, and he was early placed on important
committees. As chairman of the Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads, he was very efficient in promoting mail facilities
with our new territories and the Pacific states, and on
other important committees he accomplished a vast amount
of labor. He was deeply interested, and is still, in the prosperity
of the Pacific Railroad, regarding it as a most important
measure not only for the prosperity of the nation, but as
a means of bringing together the distant sections of our Great
Republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the Presidential Campaign of 1860, Mr. Colfax plunged
with all his energy. Mr. Lincoln had been from the first
his favorite as a candidate, and he had foreshadowed his
nomination, months before it was made, in his paper. There
were many points of resemblance in the character of the two
men, and Colfax’s heart warmed toward him as toward a
brother. Hardly any man in the United States did so much
to secure the election of Mr. Lincoln as this western editor,
and this from pure love, and not from any hope or desire
of reward. Mr. Colfax could have had, if he had sought it,
a place in Mr. Lincoln’s cabinet, as he always had, (a very
warm one,) in his heart; but he preferred to remain in Congress,
and during the whole period of the war, he was a
bosom friend and a trusted adviser of the President. In his
sound sense, his practical view of matters, and his freedom
from hobbies, Mr. Lincoln could confide, with the assurance
that his counsels would never lead him astray.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hopeful, even in the darkest hours, and ready to cheer and
encourage the drooping spirits of those whose duller vision
could not pierce the cloud-wrack, and see the clear heavens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a40'>a40</span>beyond, his presence and influence were invaluable in the
murky and treason-tainted atmosphere of the Capitol.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the assembling of the XXXVIIIth Congress in its first
session, he was chosen Speaker of the House and has been
re-elected to the same position twice since, an honor to which
no other Representative except Henry Clay has ever attained.
At the close of his present term as Speaker, he will probably
take his seat as presiding officer at the other end of the
Capitol.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the testimony of members of all parties, that he is the
best presiding officer the House has had since Henry Clay,
and in some particulars he excels Mr. Clay. He is always
genial and courteous, never betrayed into impatience or vexation,
and his marvelous quickness of thought, thorough
knowledge of parliamentary usage, and talent for the rapid
administration of details, and above all his extraordinary
tact, enable him to control the House of Representatives, even
in its most boisterous moods, with the skill and grace with
which an accomplished pilot would manage the helm of one
of our palace steamers on the Hudson. He is never at a
loss in deciding a question of order, however delicate or difficult,
and the whole array of precedents are at his command.
Very seldom indeed are his decisions overruled, and in the
rare cases in which they have been, the House have generally
found that they and not he, were in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said that his talents were administrative and
executive rather than deliberative. While this is in itself
high praise, we are inclined to doubt its entire truth. He
does possess great executive ability, and inherits from his
mother that faculty of rapid intuition, which has very properly
been denominated “mother wit;” but he has also given
indications of the possession of high reasoning and deliberative
faculties, and both his editorials and speeches give evidence
of fine logical as well as rhetorical power.</p>

<p class='c000'>He possesses, in a remarkable degree, the power of reading
character, and when called upon to select men for special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a41'>a41</span>duties he will not make mistakes. While a Radical in his
political views he is still cautious, and will adopt sure and
safe policies. His mind is well balanced, no undue predominance
of any faculty being observable, but all uniting in such
proportions as to make a sound, healthy-minded, judicious
man; one who will not be a seer far in advance of his age,
nor a conservative lagging in the rear of it, but an able leader,
to whose position the whole host of patriots will rally, and
whose views will meet with a hearty response from all lovers
of their country.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is a courteous man, not proudly or haughtily so, but
genial and gentle from the necessities of his nature. The
gentleman in his case, as in all others, is not, of necessity, he
who is gentle-born, but he who possesses a truly gentle nature.
Mr. Colfax never forgets, he remembers rather with
peculiar tenacity, the humble circumstances of his early
years, and honors with peculiar love those sons of toil, who
like himself have by diligent struggle and earnest endeavor
wrought their way up to a higher and more extended sphere
of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very pleasant illustration of this is contained in a speech
which he delivered at a dinner given him by the representatives
of the press in December 1866 at which the presiding officer,
Samuel Wilkeson, Esq., had alluded to his passing his office
at midnight, eighteen years before, while waiting for the
change of horses in the stage, and having seen him busily at
work. Mr. Colfax replied as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have had to listen to-night to a eulogy from your distinguished
chairman, of which I can only wish I was worthy.
What he has said has called back to my mind, what is often
before it, the years of my early manhood—and I see a friend
seated at this table (Mr. Defrees) who knows much of it
about as well as myself—when, struggling against poverty
and adverse fortune sometimes, I sought in the profession to
which you have devoted yourselves, to earn an honest livelihood
for myself and family, and a position, humble, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a42'>a42</span>dishonored, among the newspaper men of America. I cannot
remember the exact evening to which he alludes, when,
eighteen years ago, a stranger then, as I am glad he is not
now, he saw me through a window in my office, with the midnight
lamp before me, and heard the commentary on my life
from the lips of some too partial friend from among those who
from my boyhood have surrounded me with so much kindness
and attention. But well do I remember, in the early history
of the newspaper that numbered but two hundred and fifty
subscribers when I established it, I was often compelled to
labor far into the hours of night. And little did I dream, at
that time, I was ever to be a member of the American Congress;
and far less that I was to be the recipient of the honor
whose conferment you commemorate and endorse to-night.
I can say of that paper that its columns, from its very first
number, will bear testimony to-day that in all the political
canvasses in which I was engaged, I never avoided a frank
and outspoken expression of opinion on any question before
the American people. And that, as these opinions had always
been honestly entertained, I could not have hesitated to frankly
and manfully avow them. Though the effect of these avowals
was, from the political complexion of the district and the
State, to keep me in a minority, the people among whom I
live will bear testimony that I was no less faithful to them
then than I have been when, in later years, that minority has
by the course of events been changed into a majority.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of this speech he uttered the following noble
thoughts in regard to the vocation of the Editor, a vocation
which he continued to honor by his own participation in it,
until his assumption of the speaker’s chair. Were these
views more prevalent, journalism would be a far greater
blessing to the nation and the world than it now is.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Next to the sacred desk, and those who minister in it,
there is no profession more responsible than yours. The
editor cannot wait, like the politician, to see the set of the tide,
but is required, as new necessities arise, not only to avow at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a43'>a43</span>once his sentiments upon them, but to discuss them intelligently
and instructively. It is also his duty to guide and
protect public opinion in the proper channels, and to lay before
the readers of his sheet such matter as shall tend to the
elevation of their character. I have sometimes thought that
newspapers in their sphere might be compared to that exquisite
mechanism of the universe whereby the moisture is lifted
from the earth, condensed into clouds, and poured back again
in refreshing and fertilizing showers to bless the husbandman
and produce the abundant harvests. So, with the representatives
of the press, they draw from public opinion, condense
public opinion, and finally reflect and re-distribute it back
again in turn to its elevation and purification.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No man ever yet had occasion to complain of want of
courtesy, or <em>brusqueness</em> in Mr. Colfax’s treatment of him.
His kindness of manner comes evidently from the heart, and
men leave his presence with the impression that he is at once
an able, honest and kind man. Political opponents like him
personally, as well as his political friends, and even the bitterest
of copperheads will tell you that “after all, Schuyler
Colfax is a good fellow.” Personal enemies he has none,
and the only condemnation to which he is liable, is that of
the woe pronounced on those of whom all men speak well.</p>

<p class='c000'>The breath of slander has never sullied his fair fame. The
wife of his youth, after being for a long time an invalid, sank
to her final rest several years ago, leaving him childless. At
his receptions, which though perhaps not the most brilliant,
are certainly the most popular in Washington, his mother, a
still comely matron of but little more than sixty years, and his
sister, Miss Matthews, preside. Nothing can exceed in chivalrous
gallantry his attentions to his mother, who has been his
cherished companion from his childhood. When she enters
the gallery of the House, Mr. Colfax at once calls some member
of the House to the speaker’s chair, and hastens to her,
remaining, if possible, with her during the whole time she
continues at the Hall of Representatives.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_a44'>a44</span>Eminently social and genial in his manners, Mr. Colfax has
never fallen into the vices which have so sadly marred the
character of some of the noblest of our public men. Early
in life he signed the pledge of total abstinence from all that
could intoxicate, and that pledge he has never broken. At
the National Republican Convention at Chicago in May 1868,
at which he was nominated for the Vice-Presidency, the canvass
for him was conducted by his special command without
a drop of any intoxicating liquor. At the head-quarters of
some of the other candidates, strong drink flowed freely, but
he preferred to lose the nomination if necessary, rather than
to violate his temperance principles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Colfax is a religious man, an exemplary member of the
Reformed (Dutch) Church, and in all the relations of life,
public and private, he has maintained an active and reputable
Christian profession. The Sunday-school, the Tract, the Mission
and the Bible cause have all found in him an earnest and
cordial supporter. During the war, both the Sanitary and
the Christian Commissions were indebted to him for abundant
labors and the exertion of his powerful influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1866, in company with several friends,
Mr. Colfax crossed the continent by the overland route, and
received a hearty and cordial welcome in the Pacific States
and Territories, and increased his already deep interest in the
means of speedy and rapid communication with those portions
of the Republic. One of the results of this journey was a
lecture entitled “Across the Continent,” which he has delivered
to many thousands of our people all over the Northern
States, and almost always for the benefit of some benevolent
enterprise. He has also published another lecture, on “The
Education of the Heart,” which has been widely circulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>To sum up our estimate of his character, we have only to
say further, that the nation believes in him, trusts him, and
is willing to confide its interests to him, confident that if
either in the speedy or remote future he should be called to
the Presidency, he will not disappoint the hopes of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a45'>a45</span>should elect him, or prove treacherous to the convictions he
had previously avowed. He can not and will not under any
temptation be other than a true, honest, upright, God-fearing,
manly man. Have we not, then, answered the inquiry we
made at the beginning, why Schuyler Colfax is so popular?</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hon.</em> <span class='sc'>J. R. Hawley</span>, <em>President of the National Union Republican Convention.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: The platform adopted by the patriotic Convention over which you
presided, and the resolutions which so happily supplement it, so entirely agree
with my views as to a just national policy that my thanks are due to the Delegates
as much for this clear and auspicious declaration of principles as for the
nomination with which I have been honored, and which I gratefully accept.
When a great Rebellion, which imperiled the national existence was at last
overthrown, the duty of all others, devolving on those intrusted with the responsibilities
of legislation, evidently was to require that the revolted States should
be readmitted to participation in the Government against which they had erred
only on such a basis as to increase and fortify, not to weaken or endanger, the
strength and power of the nation. Certainly no one ought to have claimed that
they should be readmitted under such rule that their organization as States
could ever again be used, as at the opening of the war, to defy the national authority
or to destroy the national unity. This principle has been the pole-star
of those who have inflexibly insisted on the Congressional policy your Convention
so cordially endorsed. Baffled by Executive opposition, and by persistent
refusals to accept any plan of reconstruction proffered by Congress, justice and
public safety at last combined to teach us that only by an enlargement of suffrage
in those States could the desired end be attained, and that it was even
more safe to give the ballot to those who loved the Union than to those who
sought ineffectually to destroy it. The assured success of this legislation is being
written on the adamant of history, and will be our triumphant vindication.
More clearly, too, than ever before, does the nation now recognize that the
greatest glory of a republic is that it throws the shield of its protection over the
humblest and weakest of its people, and vindicates the rights of the poor and
the powerless as faithfully as those of the rich and the powerful. I rejoice, too,
in this connection, to find in your platform the frank and fearless avowal that
naturalized citizens must be protected abroad at every hazard, as though they
were native-born. Our whole people are foreigners, or descendants of foreigners;
our fathers established by arms their right to be called a nation. It remains
for us to establish the right to welcome to our shores all who are willing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_a46'>a46</span>by oaths of allegiance, to become American citizens. Perpetual allegiance, as
claimed abroad, is only another name for perpetual bondage, and would make
all slaves to the soil where first they saw the light. Our National cemeteries
prove how faithfully these oaths of fidelity to their adopted land have been sealed
in the life blood of thousands upon thousands. Should we not, then, be faithless
to the dead if we did not protect their living brethren in the full enjoyment
of that nationality for which, side by side, with the native-born, our soldiers of
foreign birth laid down their lives. It was fitting, too, that the representatives
of a party which had proved so true to national duty in time of war, should
speak so clearly in time of peace for the maintenance, untarnished, of the national
honor, national credit and good faith as regards its debt, the cost of our
national existence. I do not need to extend this reply by further comment on a
platform which has elicited such hearty approval throughout the land. The
debt of gratitude it acknowledges to the brave men who saved the Union from
destruction, the frank approval of amnesty based on repentance and loyalty, the
demand for the most thorough economy and honesty in the Government, the
sympathy of the party of liberty with all throughout the world who longed for
the liberty we here enjoy, and the recognition of the sublime principles of the
Declaration of Independence, are worthy of the organization on whose banners
they are to be written in the coming contest. Its past record cannot be blotted
out or forgotten. If there had been no Republican party, Slavery would to-day
cast its baleful shadow over the republic. If there had been no Republican
party free press and free speech would be as unknown from the Potomac to
the Rio Grande as ten years ago. If the Republican party could have been
stricken from existence when the banner of Rebellion was unfurled, and when
the response of “No Coercion” was heard at the North, we would have had no
nation to-day. But for the Republican party daring to risk the odium of tax,
and draft laws, our flag could not have been kept flying in the field until the
long-hoped for victory came. Without a Republican party the Civil Rights bill—the
guarantee of equality under the law to the humble and the defenseless as
well as the strong—would not be to-day upon our National Statute book. With
such inspiration from the past, and following the example of the founders of the
Republic, who called the victorious General of the Revolution to preside over
the land his triumphs had saved from its enemies, I cannot doubt that our labors
will be crowned with success; and it will be a success that shall bring restored
hope, confidence, prosperity, and progress South as well as North, West
as well as East, and above all, the blessings under Providence of National concord
and peace.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
